      "20:4": "Raguel, one of the holy angels who take vengeance for the world and for the luminaries.",
      "20:5": "Michael, one of the holy angels, for (he is) obedient in his benevolence over the people and the nations.",
      "20:6": "Saraqaʾel, one of the holy angels who are (set) over the spirits of mankind who sin in the spirit.",
      "20:7": "Gabriel, one of the holy angels who oversee the garden of Eden, and the serpents, and the cherubim.",
      "21:1": "And I came to an empty place.",
      "21:2": "And I saw (there) neither a heaven above nor an earth below, but a chaotic and terrible place.",
      "21:3": "And there I saw seven stars of heaven bound together in it, like great mountains, and burning with fire.",
      "21:4": "At that moment I said, “For which sin are they bound, and for what reason were they cast in here.”",
      "21:5": "Then one of the holy angels, Uriel, who was with me, guiding me, spoke to me and said to me, “Enoch, for what reason are you asking and for what reason do you question and exhibit eagerness?",
      "21:6": "These are among the stars of heaven which have transgressed the commandments of the Lord and are bound in this place until the completion of ten million years, (according) to the number of their sins.”",
      "21:7": "I then proceeded from that area to another place which is even more terrible and saw a terrible thing: a great fire that was burning and flaming; the place had a cleavage (that extended) to the last sea, pouring out great pillars of fire; neither its extent nor its magnitude could I see nor was I able to estimate.",
      "21:8": "At that moment, what a terrible opening is this place and a pain to look at!",
      "21:9": "Then Uraʾel, (one) of the holy angels who was with me, responded and said to me, “Enoch, why are you afraid like this?” (I answered and said),”",
      "21:10": "“I am frightened because of this terrible place and the spectacle of this painful thing.” And he said unto me, “This place is the prison house of the angels; they are detained here forever.”",
      "22:1": "Then went to another place, and he showed me on the west side a great and high mountain of hard rock",
      "22:2": "and inside it four beautiful corners; it had [in it] a deep, wide, and smooth (thing) which was rolling over; and it (the place) was deep and dark to look at. 3At that moment, Rufael, one of the holy angels, who was with me, responded to me; and he said to me, “These beautiful corners (are here) in order that the spirits of the souls of the dead should assemble into them—they are created so that the souls of the children of the people should gather here.",
      "22:4": "They prepared these places in order to put them (i.e. the souls of the people) there until the day of their judgment and the appointed time of the great judgment upon them.”",
      "22:5": "I saw the spirits of the children of the people who were dead, and their voices were reaching unto heaven until this very moment.",
      "22:6": "I asked Rufael, the angel who was with me, and said to him, “This spirit, the voice of which is reaching (into heaven) like this and is making suit, whose (spirit) is it?”",
      "22:7": "And he answered me, saying, “This is the spirit which had left Abel, whom Cain, his brother, had killed; it (continues to) sue him until all of (Cain’s) seed is exterminated from the face of the earth, and his seed has disintegrated from among the seed of the people.”",
      "22:8": "At that moment, I raised a question regarding him and regarding the judgment of all, “For what reason is one separated from the other?”",
      "22:9": "And he replied and said to me, “These three have been made in order that the spirits of the dead might be separated. And in the manner in which the souls of the righteous are separated (by) this spring of water with light upon it,",
      "22:10": "in like manner, the sinners are set apart when they die and are buried in the earth and judgment has not been executed upon them in their lifetime,",
      "22:11": "upon this great pain, until the great day of judgment—and to those who curse (there will be) plague and pain forever, and the retribution of their spirits. They will bind them there forever—even if from the beginning of the world.",
      "22:12": "And in this manner is a separation made for the souls of those who make the suit (and) those who disclose concerning destruction, as they were killed in the days of the sinners.",
      "22:13": "Such has been made for the souls of the people who are not righteous, but sinners and perfect criminals; they shall be together with (other) criminals who are like them, (whose) souls will not be killed on the day of judgment but will not rise from there.”",
      "22:14": "At that moment I blessed the Lord of Glory and I said, “Blessed be my Lord, the Lord of righteousness who rules forever.”",
      "23:1": "And from there I (departed and) went to another place in the direction of the west until the (extreme) ends of the earth.",
      "23:2": "And I saw a burning fire which was running without rest; and it did not diminish its speed night and day.",
      "23:3": "And I asked, saying, “What is this (thing) which has no rest?”",
      "23:4": "At that moment, Raguel, one of the holy angels, who was with me, answered me and said to me, “This (thing) which you saw is the course (of the fire) and this, the fire which is burning in the direction of the west, is the luminaries of heaven.”",
      "24:1": "From there I went to another place of the earth, and he showed me a mountain of fire which was flaming day and night.",
      "24:2": "And I went in its direction and saw seven dignified mountains—all different one from the other, of precious and beautiful stones, and all dignified and glorious in respect to their visualization and beautiful in respect to their facade—three in the direction of the east, one founded on the other, and three in the direction of the north, one upon the other, with deep and crooked ravines, each one (of which) is removed from the other.",
      "24:3": "The seven mountains were (situated) in the midst of these (ravines) and (in respect to) their heights all resembled the seat of a throne (which is) surrounded by fragrant trees.",
      "24:4": "And among them, there was one tree such as I have never at all smelled; there was not a single one among those or other (trees) which is like it; among all the fragrances nothing could be so fragrant; its leaves, its flowers, and its wood would never wither forever; its fruit is beautiful and resembles the clustered fruits of a palm tree.",
      "24:5": "At that moment I said, “This is a beautiful tree, beautiful to view, with leaves (so) handsome and blossoms (so) magnificant in appearance.”",
      "24:6": "Then Michael, one of the holy and revered angels—he is their chief—who was with me, responded to me.",
      "25:1": "And he said unto me, Enoch, “What is it that you are asking me concerning the fragrance of this tree and you are so inquisitive about?”",
      "25:2": "At that moment, I answered, saying, “I am desirous of knowing everything, but specially about this thing.”",
      "25:3": "He answered, saying, “This tall mountain which you saw whose summit resembles the throne of God is (indeed) his throne, on which the Holy and Great Lord of Glory, the Eternal King, will sit when he descends to visit the earth with goodness.",
      "25:4": "And as for this fragrant tree, not a single human being has the authority to touch it until the great judgment, when he shall take vengeance on all and conclude (everything) forever.",
      "25:5": "This is for the righteous and the pious. And the elect will be presented with its fruit for life. He will plant it in the direction of the northeast, upon the holy place—in the direction of the house of the Lord, the Eternal King.",
      "25:6": "Then they shall be glad and rejoice in gladness, and they shall enter into the holy (place); its fragrance shall (penetrate) their bones, long life will they live on earth, such as your fathers lived in their days.”",
      "25:7": "At that moment, I blessed the God of Glory, the Eternal King, for he has prepared such things for the righteous people, as he had created (them) and given it to them.",
      "26:1": "And from there I went into the center of the earth and saw a blessed place, shaded with branches which live and bloom from a tree that was cut.",
      "26:2": "And there I saw a holy mountain; underneath the mountain, in the direction of the east, there was a stream which was flowing in the direction of the north.",
      "26:3": "And I saw in a second direction, (another) mountain which was higher than (the former). Between them was a deep and narrow valley. In the direction of the (latter) mountain ran a stream.",
      "26:4": "In the direction of the west from this one there was (yet) another mountain, smaller than it and not so high, with a valley under it, and between them besides, (another) valley which is deep and dry.",
      "26:5": "(The valleys) were narrow, (formed) of hard rocks and no tree growing on them.",
      "26:6": "And I marveled at the mountain(s) and I marveled at the valley(s): I marveled very deeply.",
      "27:1": "At that moment, I said, “For what purpose does this blessed land, entirely filled with trees, (have) in its midst this accursed valley?”",
      "27:2": "Then, Uriel, one of the holy angels, who was with me, answered me and said to me, “This accursed valley is for those accursed forever; here will gather together all (those) accursed ones, those who speak with their mouth unbecoming words against the Lord and utter hard words concerning his glory. Here shall they be gathered together, and here shall be their judgment, in the last days.",
      "27:3": "There will be upon them the spectacle of the righteous judgment, in the presence of the righteous forever. The merciful will bless the Lord of Glory, the Eternal King, all the day.",
      "27:4": "In the days of the judgment of (the accursed), the (merciful) shall bless him for the mercy which he had bestowed upon them.”",
      "27:5": "At that moment, I blessed the Lord of Glory and gave him the praise that befits his glory.",
      "28:1": "And from there I went in the direction of the east into the center of the mountain of the desert; and I saw a wilderness and it was solitary, full of trees and seeds.",
      "28:2": "And there was a stream on top of it, and it gushed forth from above it.",
      "28:3": "It appeared like a waterfall which cascaded greatly as if toward the direction of west of the northeast; water and dew ascended from it all over.",
      "29:1": "Then I went into another place in the desert; and I approached the easterly direction of this mountain.",
      "29:2": "And there I saw the tree of judgment (which has) the smell of rubbish; its tree looked like that of frankincense and myrrh.",
      "30:1": "And beyond it—beyond those above the easterly mountains—it is not far. And I saw a place which is a valley of water that is endless.",
      "30:2": "And I saw a beautiful tree which resembles a tree whose fragrance is like that of mastic.",
      "30:3": "And in the direction of the sides of those valleys, I saw a fragrant cinnamon tree. And over these, I proceeded in the easterly direction.",
      "31:1": "And I saw other mountains with trees in them. There flowed from them (the trees) something like nectar, called sarara and galbanum.",
      "31:2": "And over these mountains, I saw (yet) another mountain and in it there were aloe trees, and the whole forest was full of (trees) like sturdy almond trees.",
      "31:3": "And when one picks the fruit it gives the most pleasant odor.",
      "32:1": "And after (experiencing) this fragrant odor, while looking toward the northeast over the mountains, I saw seven mountains full of excellent nard, fragrant trees, cinnamon trees, and pepper.",
      "32:2": "From there I went over the summits of the mountains, far toward the east of the earth. I (then) passed over the Erythraean Sea and went far from it, and passed over the head of angel Zutuʾel.",
      "32:3": "And I came to the garden of righteousness and saw beyond those trees many (other) large (ones) growing there—their fragrance sweet, large ones, with much elegance, and glorious. And the tree of wisdom, of which one eats and knows great wisdom, (was among them).",
      "32:4": "It looked like the colors of the carob tree, its fruit like very beautiful grape clusters, and the fragrance of this tree travels and reaches afar.",
      "32:5": "And I said, “This tree is beautiful and its appearance beautiful and pleasant!”",
      "32:6": "Then the holy angel Raphael, who was with me, responded to me and said, “This very thing is the tree of wisdom from which your old father and aged mother, they who are your precursors, ate and came to know wisdom; and (consequently) their eyes were opened and they realized that they were naked and (so) they were expelled from the garden.”",
      "33:1": "And from there I went to the extreme ends of the earth and saw there huge beasts, each different from the other—and different birds (also) differing from one another in appearance, beauty, and voice. And to the east of those beasts, I saw the ultimate ends of the earth which rests on the heaven.",
      "33:2": "And the gates of heaven were open, and I saw how the stars of heaven come out;",
      "33:3": "and I counted the gates out of which they exit and wrote down all their exits for each one: according to their numbers, their names, their ranks, their seats, their periods, their months, as Uriel, the holy angel who was with me, showed me.",
      "33:4": "He showed me all things and wrote them down for me—also in addition he wrote down their names, their laws, and their companies.",
      "34:1": "From there I went in the direction of the north, to the extreme ends of the earth, and there at the extreme end of the whole world I saw a great and glorious seat.",
      "34:2": "There (also) I saw three open gates of heaven; when it blows cold, hail, frost, snow, dew, and rain, through each one of the (gates) the winds proceed in the northwesterly direction.",
      "34:3": "Through one gate they blow good things; but when they blow with force through the two (other) gates, they blow violence and sorrow upon the earth.",
      "35:1": "And from there I went in the direction of the west to the extreme ends of the earth, and saw there three open gates of heaven, (just) like the one that I saw in the east in respect to the number of its exits.",
      "36:1": "And from there I went in the direction of the south to the extreme ends of the earth, and saw there three open gates of the heaven from where the south wind, dew, rain, and wind come forth.",
      "36:2": "From there I went in the direction of the extreme ends of the heaven and saw there open gates of heaven, with small gates above them, in the direction of the east.",
      "36:3": "Through one of these small gates pass the stars of heaven and travel westward on the path which is shown to them.",
      "36:4": "And when I saw (this) I blessed—and I shall always bless—the Lord of Glory, who performed great and blessed miracles in order that he may manifest his great deeds to his angels, the winds, and to the people so that they might praise the effect of all his creation—so that they might see the effect of his power and praise him in respect to the great work of his hands and bless him forever.",
      "37:1": "Book two: The vision which Enoch saw the second time—the vision of wisdom which Enoch, son of Jared, son of Mahalalel, son of Kenan, son of Enosh, son of Seth, son of Adam, saw:",
      "37:2": "This is the beginning of the words of wisdom which I commenced to propound, saying to those who dwell in the earth, “Listen, you first ones, and look, you last ones, the words of the Holy One, which I teach before the Lord of the Spirits.",
      "37:3": "It is good to declare these words to those of former times, but one should not withhold the beginning of wisdom from those of latter days.",
      "37:4": "Until now such wisdom, which I have received as I recited (it) in accordance with the will of the Lord of the Spirits, had not been bestowed upon me before the face of the Lord of the Spirits. From him, the lot of eternal life has been given to me.",
      "37:5": "Three things were imparted to me”; and I began to recount them to those who dwell upon the earth.",
      "38:1": "The first thing: When the congregation of the righteous shall appear, sinners shall be judged for their sins, they shall be driven from the face of the earth,",
      "38:2": "and when the Righteous One shall appear before the face of the righteous, those elect ones, their deeds are hung upon the Lord of the Spirits, he shall reveal light to the righteous and the elect who dwell upon the earth, where will the dwelling of the sinners be, and where the resting place of those who denied the name of the Lord of the Spirits? It would have been better for them not to have been born.",
      "38:3": "When the secrets of the Righteous One are revealed, he shall judge the sinners; and the wicked ones will be driven from the presence of the righteous and the elect,",
      "38:4": "and from that time, those who possess the earth will neither be rulers nor princes, they shall not be able to behold the faces of the holy ones, for the light of the Lord of the Spirits has shined upon the face of the holy, the righteous, and the elect.",
      "38:5": "At that moment, kings and rulers shall perish, they shall be delivered into the hands of the righteous and holy ones,",
      "38:6": "and from thenceforth no one shall be able to induce the Lord of the Spirits to show them mercy, for their life is annihilated.",
      "39:1": "And it shall come to pass in those days that the children of the elect and the holy ones [will descend] from the high heaven and their seed will become one with the children of the people.",
      "39:2": "And in those days Enoch received the books of zeal and wrath as well as the books of haste and whirlwind. The Lord of the Spirits says that mercy shall not be upon them.",
      "39:3": "In those days, whirlwinds carried me off from the earth, and set me down into the ultimate ends of the heavens.",
      "39:4": "There I saw other dwelling places of the holy ones and their resting places too.",
      "39:5": "So there my eyes saw their dwelling places with the holy angels, and their resting places with the holy ones, and they interceded and petitioned and prayed on behalf of the children of the people, and righteousness flowed before them like water, and mercy like dew upon the earth, and thus it is in their midst forever and ever.",
      "39:6": "And in those days my eyes saw the Elect One of righteousness and of faith, and righteousness shall prevail in his days, and the righteous and elect ones shall be without number before him forever and ever.",
      "39:7": "And I saw a dwelling place underneath the wings of the Lord of the Spirits; and all the righteous and the elect before him shall be as intense as the light of fire. Their mouth shall be full of blessing; and their lips will praise the name of the Lord of the Spirits, and righteousness before him will have no end; and uprightness before him will not cease.",
      "39:8": "There (underneath his wings) I wanted to dwell; and my soul desired that dwelling place. Already my portion is there; for thus has it been reserved for me before the Lord of the Spirits.",
      "39:9": "In those days, I praised and prayed to the name of the Lord of the Spirits with blessings and praises, for he had strengthened me by blessings and praises in accordance with the will of the Lord of the Spirits.",
      "39:10": "And I gazed at that place (under his wings), and I blessed and praised, saying, “Blessed is he, and may he be blessed, from the beginning and forever more.",
      "39:11": "There is no such thing as non-existence before him. (Even) before the world was created, he knows what is forever and what will be from generation to generation.",
      "39:12": "Those who do not slumber but stand before your glory, did bless you. They shall bless, praise, and extol (you), saying, ‘Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord of the Spirits; the spirits fill the earth.’ ”",
      "39:13": "And at that place (under his wings) my eyes saw others who stood before him sleepless (and) blessed (him), saying,",
      "39:14": "“Blessed are you and blessed is the name of the Lord of the Spirits forever and ever.” And my face was changed on account of the fact that I could not withstand the sight.",
      "40:1": "And after that, I saw a hundred thousand times a hundred thousand, ten million times ten million, an innumerable and uncountable (multitude) who stand before the glory of the Lord of the Spirits.",
      "40:2": "I saw them standing—on the four wings of the Lord of the Spirits—and saw four other faces among those who do not slumber, and I came to know their names, which the angel who came with me revealed to me; and he (also) showed me all the hidden things.",
      "40:3": "(Then) I heard the voices of those four faces while they were saying praises before the Lord of Glory.",
      "40:4": "The first voice was blessing the name of the Lord of the Spirits.",
      "40:5": "The second voice I heard blessing the Elect One and the elect ones who are clinging onto the Lord of the Spirits.",
      "40:6": "And the third voice I heard interceding and praying on behalf of those who dwell upon the earth and supplicating in the name of the Lord of the Spirits.",
      "40:7": "And the fourth voice I heard expelling the demons and forbidding them from coming to the Lord of the Spirits in order to accuse those who dwell upon the earth.",
      "40:8": "And after that, I asked the angel of peace, who was going with me and showed me everything that was hidden, “Who are these four faces which I have seen and whose voices I have heard and written down?”",
      "40:9": "And he said to me, “The first one is the merciful and forbearing Michael; the second one, who is set over all disease and every wound of the children of the people, is Raphael; the third, who is set over all exercise of strength, is Gabriel; and the fourth, who is set over all actions of repentance unto the hope of those who would inherit eternal life, is Phanuel by name.”",
      "40:10": "(So) these are his four angels: they are of the Lord of the Spirits, and the four voices which I heard in those days.",
      "41:1": "And after that, I saw all the secrets in heaven, and how a kingdom breaks up, and how the actions of the people are weighed in the balance.",
      "41:2": "And there I saw the dwelling place of the sinners and the company of the holy ones; and my eyes saw the sinners—those who deny the name of the Lord of the Spirits—being expelled from there and being dragged off; and they could not stand still because of the plague which proceeds forth from the Lord of the Spirits.",
      "41:3": "And there my eyes saw the secrets of lightning and thunder, and the mysteries of the winds, how they are distributed in order to blow upon the earth, and the secrets of the clouds and the dew I saw there from where they proceed in that place and (how) from there they satiate the dust of the earth.",
      "41:4": "At that place, I (also) saw sealed storerooms from which the winds of the storerooms of hail and the winds of the storerooms of mist are distributed; and these clouds hover over the earth from the beginning of the world.",
      "41:5": "And I saw the storerooms of the sun and the moon, from what place they come out and to which place they return, and their glorious return—how in their travel one festival is celebrated more than the other. They do not depart from their orbit, neither increase nor decrease it; but they keep faith one with another: in accordance with an oath they set and they rise.",
      "41:6": "From the first is the sun; and it executes its course in accordance with the commandment of the Lord of the Spirits—his name shall persist forever and ever.",
      "41:7": "After that is found (both) the hidden and the visible path of the moon; and the path of its orbit it completes by day and by night at that place. And the two will gaze directly into the glory of the Lord of the Spirits. They give thanks, they praise, and they do not economize (on energy), for their very essence generates new power.",
      "41:8": "Surely the many changes of the sun have (both) a blessing and a curse, and the course of the moon’s path is light to the righteous (on the one hand) and darkness to the sinners (on the other), in the name of the Lord of the Spirits, who created the distinction between light and darkness and separated the spirits of the people, and strengthened the spirits of the righteous in the name of his righteousness.",
      "41:9": "Surely, neither an angel nor Satan has the power to hinder; for there is a judge to all of them, he will glance, and all of them are before him, he is the judge.",
      "42:1": "Wisdom could not find a place in which she could dwell; but a place was found (for her) in the heavens.",
      "42:2": "Then Wisdom went out to dwell with the children of the people, but she found no dwelling place. (So) Wisdom returned to her place and she settled permanently among the angels.",
      "42:3": "Then Iniquity went out of her rooms, and found whom she did not expect. And she dwelt with them, like rain in a desert, like dew on a thirsty land.",
      "43:1": "And I saw other lightnings and the stars of heaven. And I saw how he called them each by their (respective) names, and they obeyed him.",
      "43:2": "And I saw the impartial scales for the purpose of balancing their lights at their widest areas. And their natures are as follows: Their revolutions produce lightning; and in number they are (as many as) the angels; they keep their faith each one according to their names.",
      "43:3": "And I asked the angel who was going with me and who had shown me the secret things, “What are these things?”",
      "43:4": "And he said to me, “The Lord of the Spirits has shown you the prototype of each one of them: These are the names of the holy ones who dwell upon the earth and believe in the name of the Lord of the Spirits forever and ever.”",
      "44:1": "And I saw another thing regarding lightning: how some stars arise and become lightning and cannot dwell with the rest.",
      "45:1": "This is the second parable concerning those who deny the name of the Lord of the Spirits and the congregation of the holy ones.",
      "45:2": "Neither will they ascend into heaven, nor will they reach the ground; such will be the lot of the sinners, who will deny the name of the Lord of the Spirits, those who in this manner will be preserved for the day of burden and tribulation.",
      "45:3": "On that day, my Elect One shall sit on the seat of glory and make a selection of their deeds, their resting places will be without number, their souls shall be firm within them when they see my Elect One, those who have appealed to my glorious name,",
      "45:4": "On that day, I shall cause my Elect One to dwell among them, I shall transform heaven and make it a blessing of light forever.",
      "45:5": "I shall (also) transform the earth and make it a blessing, and cause my Elect One to dwell in her. Then those who have committed sin and crime shall not set foot in her.",
      "45:6": "For in peace I have looked (with favor) upon my righteous ones and given them mercy, and have caused them to dwell before me. But sinners have come before me so that by judgment I shall destroy them from before the face of the earth.",
      "46:1": "At that place, I saw the One to whom belongs the time before time. And his head was white like wool, and there was with him another individual, whose face was like that of a human being. His countenance was full of grace like that of one among the holy angels.",
      "46:2": "And I asked the one—from among the angels—who was going with me, and who had revealed to me all the secrets regarding the One who was born of human beings, “Who is this, and from whence is he who is going as the prototype of the Before-Time?”",
      "46:3": "And he answered me and said to me, “This is the Son of Man, to whom belongs righteousness, and with whom righteousness dwells. And he will open all the hidden storerooms; for the Lord of the Spirits has chosen him, and he is destined to be victorious before the Lord of the Spirits in eternal uprightness.",
      "46:4": "This Son of Man whom you have seen is the One who would remove the kings and the mighty ones from their comfortable seats and the strong ones from their thrones. He shall loosen the reins of the strong and crush the teeth of the sinners.",
      "46:5": "He shall depose the kings from their thrones and kingdoms. For they do not extol and glorify him, and neither do they obey him, the source of their kingship.",
      "46:6": "The faces of the strong will be slapped and be filled with shame and gloom. Their dwelling places and their beds will be worms. They shall have no hope to rise from their beds, for they do not extol the name of the Lord of the Spirits.",
      "46:7": "And they have become the judges of the stars of heaven; they raise their hands (to reach) the Most High while walking upon the earth and dwelling in her. They manifest all their deeds in oppression; all their deeds are oppression. Their power (depends) upon their wealth. And their devotion is to the gods which they have fashioned with their own hands. But they deny the name of the Lord of the Spirits.",
      "46:8": "Yet they like to congregate in his houses and (with) the faithful ones who cling to the Lord of the Spirits.",
      "47:1": "“In those days, the prayers of the righteous ascended into heaven, and the blood of the righteous from the earth before the Lord of the Spirits.",
      "47:2": "There shall be days when all the holy ones who dwell in the heavens above shall dwell (together). And with one voice, they shall supplicate and pray—glorifying, praising, and blessing the name of the Lord of the Spirits—on behalf of the blood of the righteous ones which has been shed. Their prayers shall not stop from exhaustion before the Lord of the Spirits—neither will they relax forever—(until) judgment is executed for them.”",
      "47:3": "In those days, I saw him—the Antecedent of Time, while he was sitting upon the throne of his glory, and the books of the living ones were open before him. And all his power in heaven above and his escorts stood before him.",
      "47:4": "The hearts of the holy ones are filled with joy, because the number of the righteous has been offered, the prayers of the righteous ones have been heard, and the blood of the righteous has been admitted before the Lord of the Spirits.",
      "48:1": "Furthermore, in that place I saw the fountain of righteousness, which does not become depleted and is surrounded completely by numerous fountains of wisdom. All the thirsty ones drink (of the water) and become filled with wisdom. (Then) their dwelling places become with the holy, righteous, and elect ones.",
      "48:2": "At that hour, that Son of Man was given a name, in the presence of the Lord of the Spirits, the Before Time;",
      "48:3": "even before the creation of the sun and the moon, before the creation of the stars, he was given a name in the presence of the Lord of the Spirits.",
      "48:4": "He will become a staff for the righteous ones in order that they may lean on him and not fall. He is the light of the gentiles and he will become the hope of those who are sick in their hearts.",
      "48:5": "All those who dwell upon the earth shall fall and worship before him; they shall glorify, bless, and sing the name of the Lord of the Spirits.",
      "48:6": "For this purpose he became the Chosen One; he was concealed in the presence of (the Lord of the Spirits) prior to the creation of the world, and for eternity.",
      "48:7": "And he has revealed the wisdom of the Lord of the Spirits to the righteous and the holy ones, for he has preserved the portion of the righteous because they have hated and despised this world of oppression (together with) all its ways of life and its habits in the name of the Lord of the Spirits; and because they will be saved in his name and it is his good pleasure that they have life.",
      "48:8": "In those days, the kings of the earth and the mighty landowners shall be humiliated on account of the deeds of their hands. Therefore, on the day of their misery and weariness, they will not be able to save themselves.",
      "48:9": "I shall deliver them into the hands of my elect ones like grass in the fire and like lead in the water, so they shall burn before the face of the holy ones and sink before their sight, and no place will be found for them.",
      "48:10": "On the day of their weariness, there shall be an obstacle on the earth and they shall fall on their faces; and they shall not rise up (again), nor anyone (be found) who will take them with his hands and raise them up. For they have denied the Lord of the Spirits and his Messiah. Blessed be the name of the Lord of the Spirits!",
      "49:1": "So wisdom flows like water and glory is measureless before him forever and ever.",
      "49:2": "For his might is in all the mysteries of righteousness, and oppression will vanish like a shadow having no foundation. The Elect One stands before the Lord of the Spirits; his glory is forever and ever and his power is unto all generations.",
      "49:3": "In him dwells the spirit of wisdom, the spirit which gives thoughtfulness, the spirit of knowledge and strength, and the spirit of those who have fallen asleep in righteousness.",
      "49:4": "He shall judge the secret things. And no one will be able to utter vain words in his presence. For he is the Elect One before the Lord of the Spirits according to his good pleasure.",
      "50:1": "In those days, there will be a change for the holy and the righteous ones and the light of days shall rest upon them; and glory and honor shall be given back to the holy ones, on the day of weariness.",
      "50:2": "He heaped evil upon the sinners; but the righteous ones shall be victorious in the name of the Lord of the Spirits. He will cause the others to see this so that they may repent and forsake the deeds of their hands.",
      "50:3": "There shall not be honor unto them in the name of the Lord of the Spirits. But through his name they shall be saved, and the Lord of the Spirits shall have mercy upon them, for his mercy is considerable.",
      "50:4": "He is righteous in his judgment and in the glory that is before him. Oppression cannot survive his judgment; and the unrepentant in his presence shall perish.",
      "50:5": "The Lord of the Spirits has said that from henceforth he will not have mercy on them.",
      "51:1": "In those days, Sheol will return all the deposits which she had received and hell will give back all that which it owes.",
      "51:2": "And he shall choose the righteous and the holy ones from among (the risen dead), for the day when they shall be selected and saved has arrived.",
      "51:3": "In those days, (the Elect One)f shall sit on my throne, and from the conscience of his mouth shall come out all the secrets of wisdom, for the Lord of the Spirits has given them to him and glorified him.",
      "51:4": "In those days, mountains shall dance like rams; and the hills shall leap like kids satiated with milk. And the faces of all the angels in heaven shall glow with joy, because on that day the Elect One has arisen.",
      "51:5": "And the earth shall rejoice; and the righteous ones shall dwell upon her and the elect ones shall walk upon her.",
      "52:1": "After those days, in the same place where I had seen all the secret visions, having been carried off in a wind vehicle and taken to the west, my eyes saw there all the secret things of heaven and the future things.",
      "52:2": "There were (there) a mountain of iron, a mountain of copper, a mountain of silver, a mountain of gold, a mountain of colored metal, and a mountain of lead.",
      "52:3": "And I asked the angel who was going with me, saying, “What are these things which I have seen in secret?”",
      "52:4": "And he said to me, “All these things which you have seen happen by the authority of his Messiah so that he may give orders and be praised upon the earth.”",
      "52:5": "Then this angel of peace answered, saying to me, “Wait a little, and all secret things which encircle the Lord of the Spirits will be revealed unto you.",
      "52:6": "As for these mountains which you have seen with your own eyes—the mountain of iron, the mountain of copper, the mountain of silver, the mountain of gold, the mountain of colored metal, and the mountain of lead—all of them, in the presence of the Elect One, will become like a honeycomb (that melts) before fire, like water that gushes down from the top of such mountains, and become helpless by his feet.",
      "52:7": "It shall happen in those days that no one shall be saved either by gold or by silver; and no one shall be able to escape.",
      "52:8": "There shall be no iron for war, nor shall anyone wear a breastplate. Neither bronze nor tin shall be to any avail or be of any value; and there will be no need of lead whatsoever.",
      "52:9": "All these substances will be removed and destroyed from the surface of the earth when the Elect One shall appear before the face of the Lord of the Spirits.”",
      "53:1": "My eyes saw there a deep valley with a wide mouth. And all those who dwell upon the earth, the sea, and the islands shall bring to it gifts, presents, and tributes; yet this deep valley shall not become full.",
      "53:2": "They shall fulfill the criminal deeds of their hands and eat all the produce of crime which the sinners toil for. Sinners shall be destroyed from before the face of the Lord of the Spirits—they shall perish eternally, standing before the face of his earth.",
      "53:3": "So I saw all the angels of plague co-operating and preparing all the chains of Satan.",
      "53:4": "And I asked the angel of peace, who was going with me, “For whom are they preparing these chains?”",
      "53:5": "And he answered me, saying, “They are preparing these for the kings and the potentates of this earth in order that they may be destroyed thereby.",
      "53:6": "After this, the Righteous and Elect One will reveal the house of his congregation. From that time, they shall not be hindered in the name of the Lord of the Spirits.",
      "53:7": "And these mountains shall become (flat) like earth in the presence of his righteousness, and the hills shall become like a fountain of water. And the righteous ones shall have rest from the oppression of sinners.”",
      "54:1": "Then I looked and turned to another face of the earth and saw there a valley, deep and burning with fire.",
      "54:2": "And they were bringing kings and potentates and were throwing them into this deep valley.",
      "54:3": "And my eyes saw there their chains while they were making them into iron fetters of immense weight.",
      "54:4": "And I asked the angel of peace, who was going with me, saying, “For whom are these imprisonment chains being prepared?”",
      "54:5": "And he said unto me, “These are being prepared for the armies of Azazʾel, in order that they may take them and cast them into the abyss of complete condemnation, and as the Lord of the Spirits has commanded it, they shall cover their jaws with rocky stones.",
      "54:6": "Then Michael, Raphael, Gabriel, and Phanuel themselves shall seize them on that great day of judgment and cast them into the furnace (of fire) that is burning that day, so that the Lord of the Spirits may take vengeance on them on account of their oppressive deeds which (they performed) as messengers of Satan, leading astray those who dwell upon the earth.”",
      "54:7": "And in those days, the punishment of the Lord of the Spirits shall be carried out, and they shall open all the storerooms of water in the heavens above, in addition to the fountains of water which are on earth.",
      "54:8": "And all the waters shall be united with (all) other waters. That which is from the heavens above is masculine water, (whereas) that which is underneath the earth is feminine.",
      "54:9": "And they shall obliterate all those that dwell upon the earth as well as those that dwell underneath the ultimate ends of heaven.",
      "54:10": "On account of the fact that they did not recognize their oppressive deeds which they carried out on the earth, they shall be destroyed by (the Flood).",
      "55:1": "And after that the Antecedent of Time repented and said, “In vain have I destroyed all those who dwell in the earth.”",
      "55:2": "And he swore by his own great name that from thenceforth he would not do (as he had done) to all who live upon the earth. (And he said), “I shall put up a sign in the heavens, and it shall become a (symbol) of faith between me and them forever, so long as heaven is above the earth, which is in accordance with my command.",
      "55:3": "“When I would give consent so that they should be seized by the hands of the angels on the day of tribulation and pain, already I would have caused my punishment and my wrath to abide upon them—my punishment and my wrath,” says the Lord of the Spirits.",
      "55:4": "“Kings, potentates, dwellers upon the earth: You would have to see my Elect One, how he sits in the throne of glory and judges Azazʾel and all his company, and his army, in the name of the Lord of the Spirits!”",
      "56:1": "Then I saw there an army of the angels of punishment marching, holding nets of iron and bronze.",
      "56:2": "And I asked the angel of peace, who was walking with me, saying to him, “To whom are they going, these who are holding (the nets)?”",
      "56:3": "And he said to me, “(They are going) to their elect and beloved ones in order that they may be cast into the crevices of the abyss of the valley.",
      "56:4": "Then the valley shall be filled with their elect and beloved ones; and the epoch of their lives, the era of their glory, and the age of their leading (others) astray shall come to an end and shall not henceforth be reckoned.",
      "56:5": "“In those days, the angels will assemble and thrust themselves to the east at the Parthians and Medes. They will shake up the kings (so that) a spirit of unrest shall come upon them, and stir them up from their thrones; and they will break forth from their beds like lions and like hungry hyenas among their own flocks.",
      "56:6": "And they will go up and trample upon the land of my elect ones, and the land of my elect ones will be before them like a threshing floor or a highway.",
      "56:7": "But the city of my righteous ones will become an obstacle to their horses. And they shall begin to fight among themselves; and (by) their own right hands they shall prevail against themselves. A man shall not recognize his brother, nor a son his mother, until there shall be a (significant) number of corpses from among them. Their punishment is (indeed) not in vain.",
      "56:8": "In those days, Sheol shall open her mouth, and they shall be swallowed up into it and perish. (Thus) Sheol shall swallow up the sinners in the presence of the elect ones.”",
      "57:1": "And it happened afterward that I had another vision of a whole array of chariots loaded with people; and they were advancing upon the air from the east and from the west until midday.",
      "57:2": "And the sound of their chariots (was clamorous); and when this commotion took place, the holy ones in heaven took notice of it and the pillars of the earth were shaken from their foundations; and the sound (of the noise) could be heard from the extreme end of the sky unto the extreme end of the earth in one hour.",
      "57:3": "Then all shall fall down and worship the Lord of the Spirits. Here ends the second parable.",
      "58:1": "And I began to speak another parable concerning the righteous and the elect:",
      "58:2": "Blessed are you, righteous and elect ones, for glorious is your portion.",
      "58:3": "The righteous ones shall be in the light of the sun and the elect ones in the light of eternal life which has no end, and the days of the life of the holy ones cannot be numbered.",
      "58:4": "They shall seek light and find righteousness with the Lord of the Spirits. Peace (be) to the righteous ones in the peace of the Eternal Lord!",
      "58:5": "After this, it shall be told to the holy ones in heaven that they should scrutinize the mysteries of righteousness, the gift of faith. For the sun has shined upon the earth and darkness is over.",
      "58:6": "There shall be a light that has no end, and they shall not have to count days (anymore). For already darkness has been destroyed, light shall be permanent before the Lord of the Spirits, and the light of uprightness shall stand firm forever and ever before the Lord of the Spirits.",
      "59:1": "In those days, my eyes saw the mysteries of lightnings, and of lights, and their judgments; they flash lights for a blessing or a curse, according to the will of the Lord of the Spirits.",
      "59:2": "And there I (also) saw the secrets of the thunder and the secrets of (how when) it resounds in the heights of heaven its voice is heard (in) the earthly dwellings. He showed me whether the sound of the thunder is for peace and blessing or for a curse, according to the word of the Lord of the Spirits.",
      "59:3": "After that, all the mysteries of the lights and lightnings were shown to me (that) they glow with light for blessing and for contentment.",
      "60:1": "In the year five hundred, in the seventh month, on the fourteenth day of the month in the life of Enoch; in the same parable (I saw) that the heaven of heavens was quaking and trembling with a mighty tremulous agitation, and the forces of the Most High and the angels, ten thousand times a million and ten million times ten million, were agitated with great agitation.",
      "60:2": "And the Antecedent of Time was sitting on the throne of his glory surrounded by the angels and the righteous ones.",
      "60:3": "(Then) a great trembling and fear seized me and my loins and kidneys lost control. So I fell upon my face.",
      "60:4": "Then Michael sent another angel from among the holy ones and he raised me up. And when he had raised me up, my spirit returned; for (I had fainted) because I could not withstand the sight of these forces and (because) heaven has stirred up and agitated itself.",
      "60:5": "Then Michael said unto me, “What have you seen that has so disturbed you? This day of mercy has lasted until today; and he has been merciful and long-suffering toward those that dwell upon the earth.",
      "60:6": "And when this day arrives—and the power, the punishment, and the judgment, which the Lord of the Spirits has prepared for those who do not worship the righteous judgment, for those who deny the righteous judgment, and for those who take his name in vain—it will become a day of covenant for the elect and inquisition for the sinners.”",
      "60:7": "On that day, two monsters will be parted—one monster, a female named Leviathan, in order to dwell in the abyss of the ocean over the fountains of water;",
      "60:8": "and (the other), a male called Behemoth, which holds his chest in an invisible desert whose name is Dundayin, east of the garden of Eden, wherein the elect and the righteous ones dwell, wherein my grandfather was taken, the seventh from Adam, the first man whom the Lord of the Spirits created.",
      "60:9": "Then I asked the second angel in order that he may show me (how) strong these monsters are, how they were separated on this day and were cast, the one into the abysses of the ocean, and the other into the dry desert.",
      "60:10": "And he said to me, “You, son of man, according (to the degree) to which it will be permitted, you will know the hidden things.”",
      "60:11": "Then the other angel who was going with me was showing me the hidden things: what is first and last in heaven, above it, beneath the earth, in the depth, in the extreme ends of heaven, the extent of heaven;",
      "60:12": "the storerooms of the winds, how the winds are divided, how they are weighed, how the winds divide and dissipate, the openings of the winds, each according to the strength of its wind; the power of the light of the moon and how it is the right amount, the divisions of the stars, each according to its nomenclature, and all the subdivisions;",
      "60:13": "the thunders according to the places where they fall, and the subdivisions of the lightnings according to their flashing of light and the velocity of the obedience of the whole array of them.",
      "60:14": "So the thunders have their (respective) moments of rest with patience; and (each thunder) is marked by its (respective) sound. Neither the thunder nor the lightning becomes disjoined one from the other; both go together in a single breeze and do not part.",
      "60:15": "For when the lightning flashes light, the thunder utters its sound; also, at that moment, the wind causes (the thunder) to come to rest and divides equally (the time) between each one of them. For the reservoir of their moments (of thunderings) is like the sand, (so) each one of them is restrained with a bridle and turned back by the power of the wind and driven in this manner all over the numerous comers of the earth.",
      "60:16": "Now, the sea breeze is masculine and strong and according to the power of its strength it holds back (the air) and, in this manner, is driven and dispersed among all the mountains of the world.",
      "60:17": "The frost-wind is its own guardian and the hail-wind is a kind messenger.",
      "60:18": "The snow-wind has evacuated (its reservoir); it does not exist because of its strength; there is in it only a breeze that ascends from (the reservoir) like smoke, and its name is frost.",
      "60:19": "And the wind and the mist do not dwell together with them in their reservoirs. But (the mist) has its own reservoir, for its course is glorious. It has light and darkness both in the rainy season and the dry season; and its reservoir is itself an angel.",
      "60:20": "The dwelling place of the dew-breeze is in the extreme ends of heaven and is linked together with the reservoirs of the rain in (both) its courses of the rainy season and the dry season; also the clouds of (the dew) and the clouds of the mist are associated feeding each other mutually.",
      "60:21": "When the rain-wind becomes activated in its reservoir, the angels come and open the reservoir and let it out; and when it is sprayed over the whole earth, it becomes united with the water which is upon the earth;",
      "60:22": "and whensoever it unites with (other waters, it unites) with the water upon the earth which is for the use of those who dwell on the earth, for it is nourishment for the earth (sent) from the Most High in heaven. So in this manner there is a measuring system for the rain given to the angels.",
      "60:23": "All these things I saw as far as the garden of the righteous ones.",
      "60:24": "And the angel of peace who was with me said to me, “These two monsters are prepared for the great day of the Lord (when) they shall turn into food.",
      "60:25": "So that the punishment of the Lord of the Spirits should come down upon them in order that the punishment of the Lord of the Spirits should not be issued in vain but slay the children with their mothers, and the children with their fathers, when the punishment of the Lord of the Spirits comes down upon everyone. After that there shall be the judgment according to his mercy and his patience.”",
      "61:1": "I saw in those days that long ropes were given to those angels; and hoisting up their own (respective) portions (of the ropes), they soared going in the direction of the northeast.",
      "61:2": "And I asked the angel, saying unto him, “Why have those (angels) hoisted these ropes and gone off?” And he said unto me, “They have gone in order to make measurements.”",
      "61:3": "The angel who was going with me also said unto me, “These (angels) are the ones who shall bring the measuring ropes of the righteous ones as well as their binding cords in order that they might lean upon the name of the Lord of the Spirits forever and ever. Then the elect ones shall begin to walk with the elect ones.",
      "61:4": "These are the measurements which shall be given to faith and which shall strengthen righteousness.",
      "61:5": "And these measurements shall reveal all the secrets of the depths of the earth, those who have been destroyed in the desert, those who have been devoured by the wild beasts, and those who have been eaten by the fish of the sea. So that they all return and find hope in the day of the Elect One. For there is no one who perishes before the Lord of the Spirits, and no one who should perish.",
      "61:6": "And those who are in heaven above and all the powers received a command—one voice and one light like fire.",
      "61:7": "And him, the First Word, they shall bless, extol, and glorify with wisdom. They shall be wise in utterance in the spirit of life and in the Lord of the Spirits.",
      "61:8": "He placed the Elect One on the throne of glory; and he shall judge all the works of the holy ones in heaven above, weighing in the balance their deeds.",
      "61:9": "And when he shall lift up his countenance in order to judge the secret ways of theirs, by the word of the name of the Lord of the Spirits, and their conduct, by the method of the righteous judgment of the Lord of the Spirits, then they shall all speak with one voice, blessing, glorifying, extolling, sanctifying the name of the Lord of the Spirits.",
      "61:10": "And he will summon all the forces of the heavens, and all the holy ones above, and the forces of the Lord—the cherubim, seraphim, ophanim, all the angels of governance, the Elect One, and the other forces on earth (and) over the water.",
      "61:11": "On that day, they shall lift up in one voice, blessing, glorifying, and extolling in the spirit of faith, in the spirit of wisdom and patience, in the spirit of mercy, in the spirit of justice and peace, and in the spirit of generosity. They shall all say in one voice, ‘Blessed (is he) and may the name of the Lord of the Spirits be blessed forever and evermore.’",
      "61:12": "All the vigilant ones in heaven above shall bless him; all the holy ones who are in heaven shall bless him; all the elect ones who dwell in the garden of life (shall bless him); every spirit of light that is capable of blessing, glorifying, extolling, and sanctifying your blessed name (shall bless him); and all flesh shall glorify and bless your name with an exceedingly limitless power forever and ever.",
      "61:13": "For the mercy of the Lord of the Spirits is great in quantity, and he is long-suffering. All his works and all the dimensions of his creation, he has revealed to the righteous and the elect ones in the name of the Lord of the Spirits.”",
      "62:1": "Thus the Lord commanded the kings, the governors, the high officials, and the landlords and said, “Open your eyes and lift up your eyebrows—if you are able to recognize the Elect One!”",
      "62:2": "The Lord of the Spirits has sat down on the throne of his glory, and the spirit of righteousness has been poured out upon him. The word of his mouth will do the sinners in; and all the oppressors shall be eliminated from before his face.",
      "62:3": "On the day of judgment, all the kings, the governors, the high officials, and the landlords shall see and recognize him—how he sits on the throne of his glory, and righteousness is judged before him, and that no nonsensical talk shall be uttered in his presence.",
      "62:4": "Then pain shall come upon them as on a woman in travail with birth pangs—when she is giving birth (the child) enters the mouth of the womb and she suffers from childbearing.",
      "62:5": "One half portion of them shall glance at the other half; they shall be terrified and dejected; and pain shall seize them when they see that Son of Man sitting on the throne of his glory.",
      "62:6": "(These) kings, governors, and all the landlords shall (try to) bless, glorify, extol him who rules over everything, him who has been concealed.",
      "62:7": "For the Son of Man was concealed from the beginning, and the Most High One preserved him in the presence of his power; then he revealed him to the holy and the elect ones.",
      "62:8": "The congregation of the holy ones shall be planted, and all the elect ones shall stand before him.",
      "62:9": "On that day, all the kings, the governors, the high officials, and those who rule the earth shall fall down before him on their faces, and worship and raise their hopes in that Son of Man; they shall beg and plead for mercy at his feet.",
      "62:10": "But the Lord of the Spirits himself will cause them to be frantic, so that they shall rush and depart from his presence. Their faces shall be filled with shame, and their countenances shall be crowned with darkness.",
      "62:11": "So he will deliver them to the angels for punishments in order that vengeance shall be executed on them—oppressors of his children and his elect ones.",
      "62:12": "It shall become quite a scene for my righteous and elect ones. They shall rejoice over (the kings, the governors, the high officials, and the landlords) because the wrath of the Lord of the Spirits shall rest upon them and his sword (shall obtain) from them a sacrifice.",
      "62:13": "The righteous and elect ones shall be saved on that day; and from thenceforth they shall never see the faces of the sinners and the oppressors.",
      "62:14": "The Lord of the Spirits will abide over them; they shall eat and rest and rise with that Son of Man forever and ever.",
      "62:15": "The righteous and elect ones shall rise from the earth and shall cease being of downcast face. They shall wear the garments of glory.",
      "62:16": "These garments of yours shall become the garments of life from the Lord of the Spirits. Neither shall your garments wear out, nor your glory come to an end before the Lord of the Spirits.",
      "63:1": "In those days, the governors and the kings who possess the land shall plead that he may give them a little breathing spell from the angels of his punishment to whom they have been delivered; so that they shall fall and worship before the Lord of the Spirits, and confess their sins before him.",
      "63:2": "They shall bless and glorify the Lord of the Spirits and say, “Blessed is the Lord of the Spirits—the Lord of kings, the Lord of rulers, and the Master of the rich—the Lord of glory and the Lord of wisdom.",
      "63:3": "Your power exposes every secret thing from generation to generation and your glory is forever and ever. Deep are all your mysteries—and numberless; and your righteousness is beyond accounting.",
      "63:4": "Now we have come to know that we should glorify and bless the Lord of kings—him who rules over all kings.”",
      "63:5": "Moreover, they shall say, “Would that someone had given us a chance so that we should glorify, praise, and have faith before his glory!",
      "63:6": "This time, however, we are begging for a little rest but find it not; we pursue (it), but procure it not. Light has vanished from before us and darkness has become our habitation forever and ever;",
      "63:7": "because we have formerly neither had faith nor glorified the name of the Lord of the Spirits and kings, nor glorified the Lord in all his creation. We had put our hopes upon the scepters of our empires.",
      "63:8": "(Now) on the day of our hardship and our tribulation he is not saving us; and we have no chance to become believers. For our Lord is faithful in all his works, his judgments, and his righteousness; and his judgments have no respect of persons.",
      "63:9": "(So) we will vanish away from before his face on account of our deeds; and all our sins are consumed by righteousness.”",
      "63:10": "Furthermore, at that time, you shall say, “Our souls are satiated with exploitation money which could not save us from being cast into the oppressive Sheol.”",
      "63:11": "After that, their faces shall be filled with shame before that Son of Man; and from before his face they shall be driven out. And the sword shall abide in their midst, before his face.",
      "63:12": "Thus says the Lord of the Spirits, “This is the ordinance and the judgment, before the Lord of the Spirits, (prepared) for the governors, kings, high officials, and landlords.”",
      "64:1": "Then I saw in that place other mysterious faces.",
      "64:2": "And I heard the voice of an angel saying, “These are the angels who descended upon the earth and revealed what was hidden to the children of the people, and led the children of the people astray to commit sin.”",
      "65:1": "In those days, Noah saw the earth, that she had become deformed, and that her destruction was at hand.",
      "65:2": "And (Noah) took off from there and went unto the extreme ends of the earth. And he cried out to his grandfather, Enoch, and said to him, three times, with a bitter voice, “Hear me! Hear me! Hear me!”",
      "65:3": "And I said unto him, “Tell me what this thing is which is being done upon the earth, for the earth is struggling in this manner and is being shaken; perhaps I will perish with her in the impact.”",
      "65:4": "At that moment, there took place a tremendous turbulence upon the earth; and a voice from heaven was heard, and I fell upon my face.",
      "65:5": "Then Enoch, my grandfather, came and stood by me, saying to me, “Why did you cry out so sorrowfully and with bitter tears?",
      "65:6": "“An order has been issued from the court of the Lord against those who dwell upon the earth, that their doom has arrived because they have acquired the knowledge of all the secrets of the angels, all the oppressive deeds of the Satans, as well as all their most occult powers, all the powers of those who practice sorcery, all the powers of (those who mix) many colors, all the powers of those who make molten images;",
      "65:7": "how silver is produced from the dust of the earth, and how bronze is made upon the earth—",
      "65:8": "for lead and tin are produced from the earth like silver—their source is a fountain inside (which) stands an angel, and he is a running angel.”",
      "65:9": "After that, my grandfather, Enoch, took hold of me by my hand and raised me up and said to me, “Go, for I have asked the Lord of the Spirits regarding this turbulence (which is taking place) on the earth.”",
      "65:10": "He (continued to) say to me, “Because their oppression has been carried out (on the earth), their judgment will be limitless before me. On account of the abstract things which they have investigated and experienced, the earth shall perish (together with) those who dwell upon her.",
      "65:11": "And those (who taught them these things) will have no haven forever, because they have revealed to them the things which are secret—to the condemned ones; but, as for you, my son, the Lord of the Spirits knows that you are pure and kindhearted; you detest the secret things.",
      "65:12": "He has preserved your name for the holy ones; he will protect you from those who dwell upon the earth; he has preserved your righteous seed for kingship and great glory; and from your seed will emerge a fountain of the righteous and holy ones without number forever.”",
      "66:1": "After this he showed me the angels of punishment who are prepared to come and release all the powers of the waters which are underground to become judgment and destruction unto all who live and dwell upon the earth.",
      "66:2": "But the Lord of the Spirits gave an order to the angels who were on duty that they should not raise the (water) enclosures but guard (them)—for they were the angels who were in charge of the waters. Then I left from the presence of Enoch.",
      "67:1": "In those days, the word of God came unto me, and said unto me, “Noah, your lot has come up before me—a lot without blame, a lot of true love.",
      "67:2": "At this time the angels are working with wood (making an ark) and when it is completed, I shall place my hands upon it and protect it, and the seed of life shall arise from it; and a substitute (generation) will come so that the earth will not remain empty (without inhabitants).",
      "67:3": "I shall strengthen your seed before me forever and ever as well as the seeds of those who dwell with you; I shall not put it to trial on the face of the earth; but it shall be blessed and multiply on the earth in the name of the Lord.”",
      "67:4": "And they shall imprison those angels who revealed oppression in that burning valley which my grandfather Enoch had formerly shown me in the West among the mountains of gold, silver, iron, bronze, and tin.",
      "67:5": "I also saw that valley in which there took place a great turbulence and the stirring of the waters.",
      "67:6": "Now, when all this took place, there was produced from that bronze and fire a smell of sulfur (which) blended with those waters.",
      "67:7": "This valley of the perversive angels shall (continue to) burn punitively underneath that ground; in respect to its troughs, they shall be filled with rivers of water by which those angels who perverted those who dwell upon the earth shall be punished.",
      "67:8": "Those waters shall become in those days a poisonous drug of the body and a punishment of the spirit unto the kings, rulers, and exalted ones, and those who dwell on the earth; lust shall fill their souls so that their bodies shall be punished, for they have denied the Lord of the Spirits; they shall see their own punishment every day but cannot believe in his name.",
      "67:9": "In proportion to the great degree of the burning of their bodies will be the transmutation of their spirits forever and ever and ever, for there is none that can speak a nonsensical word before the Lord of the Spirits.",
      "67:10": "So the judgment shall come upon them, because they believe in the debauchery of their bodies and deny the spirit of the Lord.",
      "67:11": "And these waters will undergo change in those days; for (on the one hand) when those angels are being punished by these waters, the temperatures of those fountains of water will be altered (and become hot), but (on the other hand) when the angels get out, those waters of the fountains shall be transformed and become cold.",
      "67:12": "Then I heard Michael responding and saying, “This verdict by which the angels are being punished is itself a testimony to the kings and the rulers who control the world.”",
      "67:13": "For these waters of judgment are poison to the bodies of the angels as well as sensational to their flesh; (hence) they will neither see nor believe that these waters become transformed and become a fire that burns forever.",
      "68:1": "After that, he gave me instructions in all the secret things (found) in the book of my grandfather, Enoch, and in the parables which were given to him; and he put them together for me in the words of the book which is with me.",
      "68:2": "On that day, Michael addressed himself to Raphael, saying to him, “The power of the spirit grabs me and causes me to go up on account of the severity of the judgment concerning (the knowledge of) the secrets. Who is able to endure the severity of the judgment which has been executed and before which one melts away?”",
      "68:3": "Michael continued to speak further, saying to Raphael, “Who is he whose heart does not become sordid in respect to this matter and whose reins do not become stirred up from the word of the judgment which has been pronounced against them.”",
      "68:4": "Then it happened that when they stood before the Lord of the Spirits, Michael said to Raphael thus, “They shall not prosper before the eye of the Lord; for they have quarreled with the Lord of the Spirits because they make the image of the Lord.",
      "68:5": "Therefore, all that which has been concealed shall come upon them forever and ever; for neither an angel nor a man should be assigned his role; (so) those (evil ones) alone have received their judgment forever and ever.”",
      "69:1": "After this judgment, they shall frighten them and make them scream because they have shown this (knowledge of secret things) to those who dwell on the earth.",
      "69:2": "Now behold, I am naming the names of those angels! These are their names: The first of them is Semyaz, the second Aristaqis, the third Armen, the fourth Kokbaʾel, the fifth Turʾel, the sixth Rumyal, the seventh Danyul, the eighth Neqaʾel, the ninth Baraqel, the tenth Azazʾel, the eleventh Armaros, the twelfth Betryal, the thirteenth Basasʾel, the fourteenth Hananʾel, the fifteenth Turʾel, the sixteenth Sipweseʾel, (the seventeenth Yeterʾel), the eighteenth Tumaʾel, the nineteenth Turʾel, the twentieth Rumʾel, and the twenty-first Azazʾel.",
      "69:3": "These are the chiefs of their angels, their names, their centurions, their chiefs over fifties, and their chiefs over tens.",
      "69:4": "The name of the first is Yeqon; he is the one who misled all the children of the angels, brought them down upon the earth, and perverted them by the daughters of the people.",
      "69:5": "The second was named Asbʾel; he is the one who gave the children of the holy angels an evil counsel and misled them so that they would defile their bodies by the daughters of the people.",
      "69:6": "The third was named Gaderʾel; this one is he who showed the children of the people all the blows of death, who misled Eve, who showed the children of the people (how to make) the instruments of death (such as) the shield, the breastplate, and the sword for warfare, and all (the other) instruments of death to the children of the people.",
      "69:7": "Through their agency (death) proceeds against the people who dwell upon the earth, from that day forevermore.",
      "69:8": "The fourth is named Pinemʾe; this one demonstrated to the children of the people the bitter and the sweet and revealed to them all the secrets of their wisdom.",
      "69:9": "Furthermore he caused the people to penetrate (the secret of) writing and (the use of) ink and paper; on account of this matter, there are many who have erred from eternity to eternity, until this very day.",
      "69:10": "For human beings are not created for such purposes to take up their beliefs with pen and ink.",
      "69:11": "For indeed human beings were not created but to be like angels, permanently to maintain pure and righteous lives. Death, which destroys everything, would have not touched them, had it not been through their knowledge by which they shall perish; death is (now) eating us by means of this power.",
      "69:12": "The fifth is named Kasadya; it is he who revealed to the children of the people (the various) flagellations of all evil—(the flagellation) of the souls and the demons, the smashing of the embryo in the womb so that it may be crushed, the flagellation of the soul, snake bites, sunstrokes, the son of the serpent, whose name is Tabaʿta.",
      "69:13": "And this is the number of Kasbʾel, the chief (executor) of the oath which he revealed to the holy ones while he was (still) dwelling in the highest in glory.",
      "69:14": "His name was (then) Beqa; and he spoke to Michael to disclose to him his secret name so that he would memorize this secret name of his, so that he would call it up in an oath in order that they shall tremble before it and the oath.",
      "69:15": "He (then) revealed these to the children of the people, (and) all the hidden things and this power of this oath, for it is power and strength itself. The Evil One placed this oath in Michael’s hand.",
      "69:16": "These are the secrets of this oath—and they are sustained by the oath: The heaven was suspended before the creation of the world; and forever!",
      "69:17": "By it the earth is founded upon the water; from the hidden places of the mountains come beautiful waters, from the beginning of creation; and forever!",
      "69:18": "By that oath, the sea was created; and he put down for it a foundation of sand which cannot be transgressed at a time of its anger, from the beginning of creation; and forever!",
      "69:19": "And by that oath the depths are made firm; they stand still and do not move from their places from the beginning (of creation); and forever!",
      "69:20": "By the same oath the sun and the moon complete their courses of travel, and do not deviate from the laws (made) for them, from the beginning (of creation); and forever!",
      "69:21": "And by the same oath the stars complete their courses of travel; if they call their names, he causes them to respond from the beginning (of creation); and forever!",
      "69:22": "Likewise the waters and their souls, all the winds and their paths of travel from all the directions of winds;",
      "69:23": "the voice of the thunder and the light of the lightning are kept there;",
      "69:24": "the reservoirs of hail, the reservoirs of frost, the reservoirs of mist, the reservoirs of rain and dew are kept there;",
      "69:25": "All these believe and give thanks in the presence of the Lord of the Spirits; they glorify with all their might, and please him in all this thanksgiving; they shall thank, glorify, exalt the Lord of the Spirits forever and ever!",
      "69:26": "This oath has become dominant over them; they are preserved by it and their paths are preserved by it (so that) their courses of travel do not perish.",
      "69:27": "(Then) there came to them a great joy. And they blessed, glorified, and extolled (the Lord) on account of the fact that the name of that (Son of) Man was revealed to them.  He shall never pass away or perish from before the face of the earth.",
      "69:28": "But those who have led the world astray shall be bound with chains; and their ruinous congregation shall be imprisoned; all their deeds shall vanish from before the face of the earth.",
      "69:29": "Thenceforth nothing that is corruptible shall be found; for that Son of Man has appeared and has seated himself upon the throne of his glory; and all evil shall disappear from before his face; he shall go and tell to that Son of Man, and he shall be strong before the Lord of the Spirits. Here ends the third parable of Enoch.",
      "70:1": "And it happened after this that his living name was raised up before that Son of Man and to the Lord from among those who dwell upon the earth;",
      "70:2": "it was lifted up in a wind chariot and it disappeared from among them.",
      "70:3": "From that day on, I was not counted among them. But he placed me between two winds, between the northeast and the west, where the angels took a cord to measure for me the place for the elect and righteous ones.",
      "70:4": "And there I saw the first (human) ancestors and the righteous ones of old, dwelling in that place.",
      "71:1": "(Thus) it happened after this that my spirit passed out of sight and ascended into the heavens. And I saw the sons of the holy angels walking upon the flame of fire; their garments were white—and their overcoats—and the light of their faces was like snow.",
      "71:2": "Also I saw two rivers of fire, the light of which fire was shining like hyacinth. Then I fell upon my face before the Lord of the Spirits.",
      "71:3": "And the angel Michael, one of the archangels, seizing me by my right hand and lifting me up, led me out into all the secrets of mercy; and he showed me all the secrets of righteousness.",
      "71:4": "He also showed me all the secrets of the extreme ends of heaven and all the reservoirs of the stars and the luminaries—from where they come out (to shine) before the faces of the holy ones.",
      "71:5": "He carried off my spirit, and I, Enoch, was in the heaven of heavens. There I saw—in the midst of that light—a structure built of crystals; and between those crystals tongues of living fire.",
      "71:6": "And my spirit saw a ring which encircled this structure of fire. On its four sides were rivers full of living fire which encircled it.",
      "71:7": "Moreover, seraphim, cherubim, and ophanim—the sleepless ones who guard the throne of his glory—also encircled it.",
      "71:8": "And I saw countless angels—a hundred thousand times a hundred thousand, ten million times ten million—encircling that house. Michael, Raphael, Gabriel, Phanuel, and numerous (other) holy angels that are in heaven above, go in and out of that house—",
      "71:9": "Michael, Raphael, Gabriel, Phanuel, and numerous (other) holy angels that are countless.",
      "71:10": "With them is the Antecedent of Time: His head is white and pure like wool and his garment is indescribable.",
      "71:11": "I fell on my face, my whole body mollified and my spirit transformed. Then I cried with a great voice by the spirit of the power, blessing, glorifying, and extolling.",
      "71:12": "And those are the blessings which went forth out of my mouth, being well-pleasing in the presence of that Antecedent of Time.",
      "71:13": "Then the Antecedent of Time came with Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, Phanuel, and a hundred thousand and ten million times a hundred thousand angels that are countless.",
      "71:14": "Then an angel came to me and greeted me and said to me, “You, son of man, who art born in righteousness and upon whom righteousness has dwelt, the righteousness of the Antecedent of Time will not forsake you.”",
      "71:15": "He added and said to me, “He shall proclaim peace to you in the name of the world that is to become. For from here proceeds peace since the creation of the world, and so it shall be unto you forever and ever and ever.",
      "71:16": "Everyone that will come to exist and walk shall (follow)v your path, since righteousness never forsakes you. Together with you shall be their dwelling places; and together with you shall be their portion. They shall not be separated from you forever and ever and ever.”",
      "71:17": "So there shall be length of days with that Son of Man, and peace to the righteous ones; his path is upright for the righteous, in the name of the Lord of the Spirits forever and ever.",
      "72:1": "The Book of the Itinerary of the Luminaries of Heaven: the position of each and every one, in respect to their ranks, in respect to their authorities, and in respect to their seasons; each one according to their names and their places of origin and according to their months, which Uriel, the holy angel who was with me, and who (also) is their guide, showed me—just as he showed me all their treatises and the nature of the years of the world unto eternity, till the new creation which abides forever is created.",
      "72:2": "This is the first commandment of the luminaries: The sun is a luminary whose egress is an opening of heaven, which is (located) in the direction of the east, and whose ingress is (another) opening of heaven, (located) in the west.",
      "72:3": "I saw six openings through which the sun rises and six openings through which it sets. The moon also rises and sets through the same openings, and they are guided by the stars; together with those whom they lead, they are six in the east and six in the west heaven. All of them (are arranged) one after another in a constant order. There are many windows (both) to the left and the right of these openings.",
      "72:4": "First there goes out the great light whose name is the sun; its roundness is like the roundness of the sky; and it is totally filled with light and heat.",
      "72:5": "The chariot on which it ascends is (driven by) the blowing wind. The sun sets in the sky (in the west) and returns by the northeast in order to go to the east; it is guided so that it shall reach the eastern gate and shine in the face of the sky.",
      "72:6": "In this manner it rises in the first month through the major gate; it proceeds (through this gate) which is the fourth (among) those six openings which are (located) in the direction of the east.",
      "72:7": "By this fourth gate through which the sun rises during the first month there are twelve open windows from which a flame flows, when they are opened at the appropriate time.",
      "72:8": "When (the sun) rises (in the east) in the sky, it goes out through this fourth gate for thirty mornings and descends faithfully through the fourth gate in the western sky.",
      "72:9": "During those (thirty) days the day daily becomes longer and the night nightly shorter, for thirty days.",
      "72:10": "On that day, the day is longer than the night by one ninth; so the day turns out to be exactly ten parts and the night to be eight parts.",
      "72:11": "The sun rises from that fourth (eastern) gate and sets in the fourth (western) one, and then it turns and comes into the fifth gate of the east for thirty days, through which it rises, and sets in the fifth gate.",
      "72:12": "At that time the day further becomes longer and becomes eleven parts and the night shortens and becomes seven parts on account of the sun.",
      "72:13": "It then returns to the east and comes into the sixth (gate), rising and setting through that sixth gate for thirty-one days, according to the principle of (the gate).",
      "72:14": "On that day the day becomes longer than the night still further; so the day becomes twelve parts and the night shortens and becomes six is parts.",
      "72:15": "Then the sun is raised in such a way that (its duration) shortens and night occurs; the sun returns to the east and enters the sixth gate, rising and setting through it for thirty days.",
      "72:16": "When thirty days are completed, the day decreases exactly by one part, and becomes eleven parts, and the night seven.",
      "72:17": "Then the sun, leaving the west by that sixth gate and going to the east, rises through the fifth gate for thirty mornings and sets again in the fifth gate in the west.",
      "72:18": "On that day the day decreases by two parts; so (the day) becomes ten parts and the night eight parts.",
      "72:19": "Then the sun, departing from that fifth gate and setting in the fifth gate, in the west, rises in the fourth gate for thirty-one days according to the principle of (the gate), and sets in the west.",
      "72:20": "On that day the day is aligned with the night, so that they become equal; so the night becomes nine parts and the day nine parts.",
      "72:21": "Then the sun, departing from that gate and setting in the west, returns to the east and comes out through the third gate for thirty days, and sets in the third gate in the west.",
      "72:22": "On that day the night becomes longer than the day; it becomes longer than the (previous) night and the day becomes shorter than the (previous) day for thirty day; so the night turns out to be exactly ten parts and the day to be eight parts.",
      "72:23": "Then the sun, departing from that third gate in the west and returning to the east, comes out through the second gate in the east for thirty days, and in the same manner it sets through the second gate in the western sky.",
      "72:24": "On that day the night becomes eleven parts and the day seven parts.",
      "72:25": "Then the sun, departing on that day from that second gate and setting in the west in the second gate, returns to the east and rises in the first gate for thirty-one days, and sets on that day in the western sky.",
      "72:26": "On that day the night lengthens and becomes twelve parts, whereas the day (shortens and becomes) six parts.",
      "72:27": "Thus the sun completes its appearances, and goes through those same cycles of appearances a second time, coming out through all the openings for thirty days and setting also in the west opposite to it.",
      "72:28": "On that night the length of the night decreases by one ninth; so the night becomes eleven parts and the day seven parts.",
      "72:29": "Then the sun, returning and entering the second gate which is in the east, resumes its appearances for thirty mornings, rising and setting (as usual).",
      "72:30": "On that day the night becomes shorter, so the night becomes ten parts and the day eight parts.",
      "72:31": "On that day the sun, departing from this second gate and setting in the west, returns to the east and rises through the third gate for thirty-one days, and sets in the western sky.",
      "72:32": "On that day the night shortens and becomes nine parts and the day nine parts. Then the night becomes equal with the day, and the days (of the year) add up to exactly three hundred sixty-four days.",
      "72:33": "The lengths of the day and the night as well as the shortnesses of the day and the night are (determined) by (the course of) the circuit of the sun, and distinguished by it.",
      "72:34": "The circuit becomes longer or shorter day by day and night by night (respectively).",
      "72:35": "Thus this is the order for the course of the movement and the settlement of the sun—that great luminary which is called the sun, for the duration of the year(s) of the universe—in respect to its going in and coming out.",
      "72:36": "It is that very (luminary) which manifests itself in its appearance as God has commanded that it shall come out and go in, in this manner.",
      "72:37": "And neither does it diminish (in respect to its brightness) not take rest but continue to run day and night. As for the intensity of its light, it is sevenfold brighter than that of the moon; nevertheless, (the sun and the moon) are equal in regard to their (respective) sizes.",
      "73:1": "After I saw this (set of) regulation(s for the sun) I saw another (set of) regulation(s)a concerning the minor luminary whose name is moon.",
      "73:2": "Its roundness is like the roundness of the sky, and the wind drives the chariot on which it rides; and it is given light in (varying) measure.",
      "73:3": "Its coming out and its going in change every month. Its days are like the days of the sun; and when its light becomes evenly (distributed) then it amounts to one seventh of the light of the sun.",
      "73:4": "It (the moon) rises in this manner: Its head faces the easterly direction, coming out on the thirtieth day, on that day, (that is,) on the thirtieth day, it comes into existence, and it appears with the sun in the gate through which the sun exits; and you have the beginning of the month.",
      "73:5": "(Considering) half of it to be (divisible into) seven parts, the whole disk of it is without light, with the exception of one-seventh part of the fourteenth part of the light (of the sun), one seventh of its (half) light.",
      "73:6": "On the day when it receives one-seventh part of its one half, as the sun sets, it becomes (equivalent to) one-seventh light of one half of it.",
      "73:7": "Then when the sun rises, the moon rises together with it, taking a portion of one half of its light; that night (the moon), just beginning its monthly journey on its first lunar day, sets with the sun and becomes dark, in respect to its thirteen parts that night. On that day it rises and shines with exactly one-seventh part (of its semicircle).",
      "73:8": "Then it comes out and recedes toward the east (away from) where the sun rises, (continuing) to be bright(er) in one sixth of one seventh (of one half of the light of the sun) during the remaining days.",
      "74:1": "Furthermore, I saw another system of rotation with its own regulation whereby the system fulfills its monthly course of movement.",
      "74:2": "All these things—including their fixed positions—Uriel, the holy angel who is the guide of all of them, showed to me. And I wrote down their fixed positions as he showed them to me; and I wrote down their months as they were, as well as the (variable) aspects of their illumination until the completion of fifteen days.",
      "74:3": "The moon wanes in fifteen steps during a period of fifteen days, and waxes in fourteen steps in the east and the west respectively.",
      "74:4": "In (certain) designated months it alters its (westerly) settings and in (certain) designated months it fulfills its unusual courses of movement.",
      "74:5": "For two months it (the moon) sets with the sun, and uses those two middle openings (which are) the third and the fourth gate.",
      "74:6": "It comes out for seven days and completes a circuit as it returns again to the gate through which the sun rises. In this manner it waxes and recedes from the sun, entering the sixth gate through which the sun rises in eight days.",
      "74:7": "When the sun rises through the fourth gate (the moon) comes out for seven days, until it starts coming out through the fifth. It then turns back toward the fourth gate in seven days, waxing as it recedes, and enters the first gate in eight days.",
      "74:8": "Then again it returns to the fourth gate through which the sun rises in seven days.",
      "74:9": "This is how I saw their fixed positions—how the moon rises and shines when the sun sets—in those days.",
      "74:10": "If five years are combined the sun gains thirty extra days; consequently one of those five years gains, and when it is completed, it turns out to be three hundred sixty-four days.",
      "74:11": "The gain of the sun and of the stars turns out to be six days; in five years, six days every year add up to thirty days; and the moon falls behind the sun and the stars for thirty days.",
      "74:12": "They bring about all the years punctiliously, so that they forever neither gain upon nor fall behind their fixed positions for a single day, but they convert the year with punctilious justice into three hundred sixty-four days.",
      "74:13": "In three (years) there are one thousand ninety-two days and in five years one thousand eight hundred and twenty days, so that in eight years there are two thousand nine hundred and twelve days.",
      "74:14": "For the moon singly in three (years) its days add up to one thousand thirty is days, so that it falls behind by sixty-two days in three years.",
      "74:15": "In five years (they add up to) one thousand eight hundred seventy days, so that it falls behind by fifty days in five years. Thus it is for the moon.",
      "74:16": "In eight years the days (add up to) two thousand eight hundred thirty-two days, so that it falls behind by eight days in eight years.",
      "74:17": "(In this way) the years are completed with precision, in accordance with their fixed positions in the universe and the fixed stations of the sun which shine, the gate through which it (the sun) rises and sets for thirty days.",
      "75:1": "The leaders of the chiefs of the thousands, which are appointed over the whole creation and upon all the stars, are counted together with the four (leaders of the seasons); they do not leave from the fixed stations according to the reckoning of the year; and they render service on the four days which are not counted in the reckoning of the year.",
      "75:2": "On this account, people err in them, for those luminaries scrupulously render service to the fixed positions in the cosmos—one in the first gate of heaven, one in the third, one in the fourth, one in the fifth, and one in the sixth. In this manner the year is completed scrupulously in three hundred sixty-four fixed stations of the cosmos.",
      "75:3": "Thus the signs, the durations of time, the years, and the days were shown to me (by) the angel Uriel, whom the Lord, God of eternal glory, has appointed over all the luminaries of heaven—(both) in heaven and the world—in order that they—the sun, the moon, the stars, and all the created objects which circulate in all the chariots of heaven—should rule in the face of the sky and be seen on the earth to be guides for the day and the night.",
      "75:4": "Likewise Uriel showed me twelve wide openings in the sky, along the course of the chariots of the sun, from which the rays of the sun break out and from which heat is diffused upon the earth, when they are opened during the designated seasons.",
      "75:5": "Their openings (affect) the winds and the spirit of the dew,",
      "75:6": "(that is) when the twelve wide openings are opened in the sky, in the extreme ends of the earth, through which (also) the sun, the moon, the stars, and all the (other) heavenly objects come out in the west.",
      "75:7": "There are many open windows to the left and the right, but one window produces the heat at its designated time in the manner of those openings through which the stars rise in accordance with their orders and set according to their numbers.",
      "75:8": "I also saw chariots in heaven running in the universe above those openings in which the stars that do not set revolve.",
      "75:9": "One (circuit) is larger than the rest of them all, and it circles the entire cosmos at the extreme ends of the earth.",
      "76:1": "And I saw the twelve wide openings in all the directions through which the winds come out and blow over the earth.",
      "76:2": "Three of them are open in the forefront of the sky, three in the west, three in the right of the sky, and three on the left;",
      "76:3": "(in other words) the first three are those on the morning side (followed by) three in the direction of the north; the last three are those on the left, in the direction of the south (followed by) three in the west.",
      "76:4": "Through four of the (openings)g blow out winds of blessing (and) through eight of them blow out winds of pestilence—when they are sent in order to destroy the whole earth, the water upon her, all those who dwell upon her, and all those which exist in the waters and the dry land.",
      "76:5": "The first (group of) winds goes out from those openings called the easterly. Out of the first gate, which is in the direction of the east and inclines toward the south, proceed extirpation, drought, pestilence, and destruction.",
      "76:6": "Out of the second gate, (located) directly in the center, proceed rain and fruitfulness together with dew. Out of the third gate, which is in the direction of the northeast, proceed (both) cold and drought.",
      "76:7": "After these winds, there go out the southerly ones through three gates. Among these, out of the first gate, which inclines in the direction of the east, proceed the winds of heat.",
      "76:8": "Out of the central gate, which is next to it, proceed beautiful fragrance, dew, rain, peace, and life.",
      "76:9": "And out of the third gate, in the direction of the west, proceed dew, rain, young locusts, and desolation.",
      "76:10": "After these, there goes (the group) of the northerly winds whose name is the Sea. There proceed from the seventh gate, which is in the direction of the east, toward the south, dew, rain, young locusts, and desolation.",
      "76:11": "Out of the central gate proceed life, rain, and dew directly; and out of the third gate, which is in the direction of the west, which inclines toward the northeast, proceed cloud, frost, snow, rain, dew, and young locusts.",
      "76:12": "After these come the fourth (group) of winds—the westerly. Out of the first gate, which is in the northeasterly direction, proceed dew, frost, cold, snow, and hoarfrost.",
      "76:13": "Out of the central gate proceed dew, rain, peace, and blessing. And out of the last gate, which is in the direction of the south, proceed drought, desolation, burning, and destruction.",
      "76:14": "Thus the twelve openings of the four heavenly directions are completed; all their orders, all their evil effects, and all their beneficial effects have I revealed to you, (O) my son, Methuselah!",
      "77:1": "* The first direction is called the Orient, because it is the very first.",
      "77:2": "The second is called the South, because the Most High will descend there, indeed because the Eternally Blessed will descend there.",
      "77:3": "(The third) direction is the Occident, its name (means) the diminished, (because) there all the luminaries of the sky wane and descend.",
      "77:4": "The fourth direction, whose name is the North, is divided into three parts: One of them is the dwelling of human beings; the second the seas of water, lakes, forests, rivers, darkness, and clouds; and the third part the garden of righteousness.",
      "77:5": "I saw seven high mountains which were higher than all the mountains of the earth; out of them proceeds frost; and days and year(s) traverse (them) in due season.",
      "77:6": "I saw seven rivers upon the earth, larger than all the rivers; one of them emerges from the West and empties its water into the Great Sea.",
      "77:7": "Two (others) come from the Northeast to the sea and empty their water into the Erythraean Sea, in the East.",
      "77:8": "The four remaining ones come out of the side of the Northeast to their own (respective) seas—(two of them) to the Erythraean Sea and two of them to the Great Sea, pouring themselves therein; some say to the seventh desert.",
      "77:9": "I (also) saw big islands in the sea and the land—seventy-two in the Erythraean Sea.",
      "78:1": "These are the names of the sun: the first, ʾOryares and the second, Tomas.",
      "78:2": "The moon has four names: Its first name is Asenya; its second, ʾAbla; the third, Banase; and the fourth, ʾEra.",
      "78:3": "These are the two great luminaries. Their roundness is like the roundness of the sky; and the magnitude of their roundness is equivalent for both.",
      "78:4": "There are seven (more) portions of light that move in the sun’s sphere than in the moon’s and it increases in measure until seventy portions of the sun are completed.",
      "78:5": "The (moon) comes in and goes out by the western openings, and circles via the northeast and rises through the eastern openings upon the face of the earth.",
      "78:6": "When the moon (begins its cycle), it appears in the sky one half of a seventh part; it will become fully illumined from the fourteenth (day);",
      "78:7": "it completes its illumination the fifteenth, becoming fulfilled according to the sign of the year and becoming fifteen parts. Thus the moon waxes in fifteen parts.",
      "78:8": "In its waning, (the moon) decreases on the first day to fourteen parts of its light; on the second day, it decreases to thirteen parts of light; on the third, to twelve parts; on the fourth, to eleven parts; on the fifth, to ten parts; on the sixth, to nine parts; on the seventh, to eight parts; on the eighth, to seven parts; on the ninth, to six parts; on the tenth, to five parts; on the eleventh, to four parts; on the twelfth, to three parts; on the thirteenth, to one half (of the preceding); on the fourteenth, all its light decreases to one half of one seventh; and on the fifteenth, all the remaining (light) disappears.",
      "78:9": "In certain fixed months, the moon completes its cycle every twenty-nine days, (in certain others), every twenty-eight.",
      "78:10": "Then Uriel showed me another order (concerning) when light is beamed into the moon, from which (direction) of the bright sun it is beamed.",
      "78:11": "During all the seasons when the moon is made to run its cycle, the light is being beamed into it (the moon) facing the sun until the illumination (of the moon) is completed in the course of fourteen days; and when it is lit completely, it radiates light in the sky.",
      "78:12": "On the first day, it is called the new moon because on that day the illumination begins to set upon it.",
      "78:13": "These (illuminations) are completed with exactitude on the day when the sun descends into the west, and the moon (simultaneously) rises in the east in the evening, shining during the night until the sun rises opposite it, and it is over against the sun.",
      "78:14": "From the same side where light entered the moon, from there also it (gradually) wanes until all the illumination disappears and the days of the moon expire, its disk empty without light.",
      "78:15": "(The moon) coordinates, in respect to its days and seasons, (four) three-month (divisions). In the course of its recession it makes (three months each in thirty days) and three months each in twenty-nine days; during this season it makes its recession, in the first period, (starting) in the first gate, (in) one hundred and seventy-seven days.",
      "78:16": "In the course (of) its progression, it appears three months each in thirty days and three months each in twenty-nine days.",
      "78:17": "By night it appears like a man, and by day it appears like the sky; for there is no other thing in it except its light.",
      "79:1": "(Thus) now, my son, I have revealed to you everything; (so) the rules concerning all the stars of heaven are concluded (here).",
      "79:2": "(Indeed) he showed me all their respective rules for every day, for every season, and for every year; the procession of each one according to the commandment, every month and every week.",
      "79:3": "(He showed me) the total decrement (i.e. during a half lunar year) of the moon which it makes (from the first) through the sixth gate, for (after) the light of this sixth gate is disposed of (at the end of the series of the six gates), the beginning of the decrement",
      "79:4": "(i.e. during the other half lunar year) which it makes (in returning) in the first gate takes place in its own season until one hundred and seventy-seven days are fulfilled, following the rule of (counting) weeks, twenty-five (weeks) and two days.",
      "79:5": "(The moon) falls behind the sun according to the order of the stars exactly five days during one period (i.e. one half year), and when the place which you behold has been traversed.",
      "79:6": "Such is the appearance and the picture of all the luminaries which Uriel the archangel, who is their leader, showed unto me.",
      "80:1": "In those days, the angel Uriel responded and said to me, “Behold, I have shown you everything, Enoch, and I have revealed everything to you (so that) you might see this sun, this moon, and those that guide the stars of heaven as well as all those who interchange their activities and their seasons and rotate their processions.",
      "80:2": "In respect to their days, the sinners and the winter are cut short. Their seed(s)f shall lag behind in their lands and in their fertile fields, and in all their activities upon the earth. He will turn and appear in their time, and withhold rain; and the sky shall stand still at that time.",
      "80:3": "Then the vegetable shall slacken and not grow in its season, and the fruit shall not be born in its (proper) season.",
      "80:4": "The moon shall alter its order, and will not be seen according to its (normal) cycles.",
      "80:5": "In those days it will appear in the sky and it shall arrive in the evening in the extreme ends of the great lunar path, in the west. And it shall shine (more brightly), exceeding the normal degree of light.",
      "80:6": "Many of the chiefs of the stars shall make errors in respect to the orders given to them; they shall change their courses and functions and not appear during the seasons which have been prescribed for them.",
      "80:7": "All the orders of the stars shall harden (in disposition) against the sinners and the conscience of those that dwell upon the earth. They (the stars) shall err against them (the sinners); and modify all their courses. Then they (the sinners) shall err and take them (the stars) to be gods.",
      "80:8": "And evil things shall be multiplied upon them; and plagues shall come upon them, so as to destroy all.",
      "81:1": "Then he said unto me, “Enoch, look at the tablet(s) of heaven; read what is written upon them and understand (each element on them) one by one.",
      "81:2": "So I looked at the tablet(s) of heaven, read all the writing (on them), and came to understand everything. I read that book and all the deeds of humanity and all the children of the flesh upon the earth for all the generations of the world.",
      "81:3": "At that very moment, I blessed the Great Lord, the King of Glory for ever, for he has created all the phenomena in the world. I praised the Lord because of his patience; and I wept on account of the children of the people upon the earth.",
      "81:4": "After that, I said: Blessed is the man who dies righteous and upright, against whom no record of oppression has been written, and who received no judgment on that day.",
      "81:5": "Then the seven holy ones brought me and placed me on the ground in front of the gate of my house, and said to me, “Make everything known to your son, Methuselah, and show to all your children that no one of the flesh can be just before the Lord; for they are merely his own creation.",
      "81:6": "We shall let you stay with your son for one year, so that you may teach your children another law and write it down for them and give all of them a warning; and in the second year, you shall be taken away from (among) all of them.",
      "81:7": "Let your heart be strong! For the upright shall announce righteousness to the upright; and the righteous ones shall rejoice with the righteous ones and congratulate each other.",
      "81:8": "But the sinners shall die together with the sinners; and the apostate shall sink together with the apostate.",
      "81:9": "But those who do right shall not die on account of the (evil) deeds of the people; it will gather on account of the deeds of the evil ones.”",
      "81:10": "In those days, (those seven holy ones) concluded speaking with me; and then I returned to my people, blessing the Lord of the universe.",
      "82:1": "Now, Methuselah, my son, I shall recount all these things to you and write them down for you. I have revealed to you and given you the book concerning all these things. Preserve, my son, the book from your father’s hands in order that you may pass it to the generations of the world.",
      "82:2": "I have given wisdom to you, to your children, and to those who shall become your children in order that they may pass it (in turn) to their own children and to the generations that are discerning. All the wise ones shall give praise, and wisdom shall dwell upon your consciousness;",
      "82:3": "they shall not slumber but be thinking; they shall cause their ears to listen in order that they may learn this wisdom; and it shall please those who feast on it more than good food.",
      "82:4": "Blessed are all the righteous ones; blessed are those who walk in the street of righteousness and have no sin like the sinners in the computation of the days in which the sun goes its course in the sky. It (the sun) comes in through a door and rises for thirty days together with the chiefs of the thousands of the orders of the stars, together with the four which are added to determine the intervals within (the year, that is, the intervals) between the four seasons of the year; those that lead them along come in on four days.",
      "82:5": "On this account there are people that err; they count them (the four?) in the computation of the year: for the people make error and do not recognize them accurately; for they belong to the reckoning of the year.",
      "82:6": "Truly, they are recorded forever: one in the first gate, one in the third, one in the fourth, and one in the sixth. The year is completed in three hundred and sixty-four days.",
      "82:7": "True is the matter of the exact computation of that which has been recorded; for Uriel—whom the Lord of all the creation of the world has ordered for me (in order to explain) the host of heaven—has revealed to me and breathed over me concerning the luminaries, the months, the festivals, the years, and the days.",
      "82:8": "He has the power in the heaven both day and night so that he may cause the light to shine over the people—sun, moon, and stars, and all the principalities of the heaven which revolve in their (respective) circuits.",

      "82:11": "The four leaders which distinguish the four seasons of the year enter first; after them (enter) the twelve leaders of the orders which distinguish the months; and the three hundred and sixty captains which divide the days and the four epagomenal days, (and) leaders which divide the four seasons of the year.",
      "82:12": "These captains over thousands are added between leader and leader, each behind a place to stand; but their leaders make the division.",
      "82:13": "And these are the names of the leaders which divide the four seasons of the years which are fixed: Malkiʾēl, Hēlaʾemmemēlek, Milāyʾul, and Nārēl.",
      "82:14": "The names of those who lead them are ʾAdnārʾul, ʾIyāsus-ʾēl, ʾĒlumʾēl—these three follow the leaders of the orders, as well as the four which follow after the three leaders of the orders, which follow after those leaders of the stations that divide the is four seasons of the year.",
      "82:15": "At the very beginning, Malkiyal, whose name is called Tamʾayen—and the sun—rises and rules; and all the days of his authority—during which he reigns—are ninety-one days.",
      "82:16": "And these are the signs of the days which become manifest during the period of his authority: sweat, heat, and dryness; all the trees bear fruit (and) leaves grow on all trees; (there will be) good harvest, rose flowers, and all the flowers which grow in the field; but the winter tree shall wither.",
      "82:17": "And these are the names of the leaders which are their subordinates: Berkāʾēl, Zalebsāʾēl, and another additional one, a captain of a thousand, named Hēluyāsāf—the days of the authority of this one have been completed.",
      "82:18": "The next leader after him is Helaʿemmemēlēk, whose name they call the bright sun; and all the days of his light are ninety-one days.",
      "82:19": "And these are the days of signs upon signs upon the earth: scorching heat and drought; and trees will produce their glowing fruits and impart of their ripened ones; the sheep shall seek (one another) and become pregnant; and all the fruits of the earth are gathered in, and all that is in the fields as well as the winepress.

      "83:1": "Now, my son Methuselah, I will show you all the visions which I saw, recounting them before you.",
      "83:2": "I saw two (visions) before I got married; and neither one of them resembles the other: The first one (I saw) when I (was beginning to) learn book(s), and the second, before I got married to your mother. First, I saw a scary vision regarding which I prayed to the Lord.",
      "83:3": "I was (then) sleeping in my grandfather Mahalalel’s house, and I saw in a vision the sky being hurled down and snatched and falling upon the earth.",
      "83:4": "When it fell upon the earth, I saw the earth being swallowed up into the great abyss, the mountains being suspended upon mountains, the hills sinking down upon the hills, and tall trees being uprooted and thrown and sinking into the deep abyss.",
      "83:5": "Thereupon a word fell into my mouth; and I began crying aloud, saying, “The earth is being destroyed.”",
      "83:6": "Then my grandfather, Mahalalel, woke me up while I was sleeping together with him and said to me, “What happened to you that you are crying aloud like this, my son, and why are you lamenting in this manner?”",
      "83:7": "And I recounted to him the whole vision which I had seen. And he said unto me, “How terrifying a thing have you seen, my son! You have seen in your dream a powerful vision—all the sins of the whole world as it was sinking into the abyss and being destroyed with great destruction.",
      "83:8": "Now, my son, rise and pray to the Lord of glory, for you are a man of faith, so that a remnant shall remain upon the earth and that the whole earth shall not be blotted out.”",
      "83:9": "My son, all the things upon the earth shall take place from heaven; and there will occur a great destruction upon the earth.",
      "83:10": "After that, I rose and prayed, made a petition, and begged; and I wrote down all the prayers of the generations of the world. I will show you everything, my son, Methuselah.",
      "83:11": "Had I descended underneath and seen the sky, the sun rising in the east, the moon descending in the west, the diminishing of the stars, and the whole earth, I would have recognized everything upon her. So I blessed the Lord of judgment and extolled him. For he has made the sun to come out from the windows of the east; so it ascended and rose upon the face of the sky, starting to go the way that it was shown.",
      "84:1": "Then I raised up my hands in righteousness and blessed the Holy and Great One; and I spoke with the breath of my mouth and the tongue of flesh which God has made for the children of the flesh, the people, so that they should speak with it; he gave them the breath and the mouth so that they should speak with it.",
      "84:2": "Blessed are you, O Great King, you are mighty in your greatness, O Lord of all the creation of heaven, King of kings and God of the whole world. Your authority and kingdom abide forever and ever; and your dominion throughout all the generations of generations; all the heavens are your throne forever, and the whole earth is your footstool forever and ever and ever.",
      "84:3": "For you have created (all), and all things you rule; not a single thing is hard for you—(absolutely) not a single thing or wisdom; Your throne has not retreated from her station nor from before your presence. Everything you know, you see, and you hear; nothing exists that can be hidden from you, for everything you expose.",
      "84:4": "The angels of your heavens are now committing sin (upon the earth), and your wrath shall rest upon the flesh of the people until (the arrival of) the great day of judgment",
      "84:5": "“Now, O God, and Lord and Great King, I pray and beg so that you may sustain my prayer and save for me (a generation) that will succeed me in the earth; and do not destroy all the flesh of the people and empty the earth (so that) there shall be eternal destruction.",
      "84:6": "Do now destroy, O my Lord, the flesh that has angered you from upon the earth, but sustain the flesh of righteousness and uprightness as a plant of eternal seed; and hide not your face from the prayer of your servant, O Lord.”",
      "85:1": "After this, I saw another dream; and I will show you everything, my son.",
      "85:2": "Then Enoch responded and said to his son, Methuselah: I shall speak to you, my son, hear my words and incline your ears to the dream vision of your father.",
      "85:3": "Before I married your mother, Edna, I was seeing a vision on my bed, and behold a cow emerged from the earth, and that bovid was snow-white; and after it, there came forth one female calf together with two other calves, one of which was dark and the other red.",
      "85:4": "The dark calf gored that red calf and pursued it over the earth; thereafter I was not able to see that red calf.",
      "85:5": "But the dark calf grew big, and it brought along that female calf; and I saw that many bovids, which resembled it, proceeded forth from it, and followed after them.",
      "85:6": "That first heifer departed from before the face of that first bovid, and looked for that red calf, but could not find it; so she lamented over it with great lamentation, in searching for it.",
      "85:7": "I kept looking until that first cow came and quieted her; from that moment, she stopped crying.",
      "85:8": "After that she bore two snow-white cows; and after it she bore many more cows as well as dark heifers.",
      "85:9": "I also saw in my sleep that snow-white bull, and he grew big likewise and became a great snow-white bull; and there proceeded forth from him many snow-white cows which resembled him.",
      "85:10": "Then they began to give birth to many snow-white cows which resembled them, each one following many others.",
      "86:1": "Again I saw (a vision) with my own eyes as I was sleeping, and saw the lofty heaven; and as I looked, behold, a star fell down from heaven but (managed) to rise and eat and to be pastured among those cows.",
      "86:2": "Then I saw these big and dark cows, and behold they all changed their cattle-sheds, their pastures, and their calves; and they began to lament with each other.",
      "86:3": "Once again I saw a vision, and I observed the sky and behold, I saw many stars descending and casting themselves down from the sky upon that first star; and they became bovids among those calves and were pastured together with them, in their midst.",
      "86:4": "I kept observing, and behold, I saw all of them extending their sexual organs like horses and commencing to mount upon the heifers, the bovids; and they (the latter) all became pregnant and bore elephants, camels, and donkeys.",
      "86:5": "So (the cattle) became fearful and frightened of them and began to bite with their teeth and swallow and to gore with their horns.",
      "86:6": "Then they began to eat those bovids. And behold, all the children of the earth began to tremble and to shake before them and to flee from them.",
      "87:1": "Again I saw them commencing to gore and devour one another; so the earth began to cry aloud.",
      "87:2": "And I lifted my eyes unto heaven and saw a vision: And behold, there came forth from heaven (a being) in the form of a snow-white person—one came out of that place and three (others) with him.",
      "87:3": "Those ones which had come out last seized me by my hand and took me from the generations of the earth, lifted me up into a high place, and showed me a high tower above the earth, and all the hills were firm.",
      "87:4": "(One of them) said to me, “Stay here until you see everything that will happen to these elephants, camels, and donkeys, as well as to the stars and to the bovids—all of them.”",
      "88:1": "I then saw one of those four who had come out earlier seizing that first star, binding his hands and feet, and throwing him into an abyss—this abyss was narrow and deep, empty and dark.",
      "88:2": "Also one of them drew a sword and gave it to those elephants, camels, and donkeys; then they began to attack one another, and on account of them the whole earth was quaking.",
      "88:3": "And as I continued to see in the vision, behold, from that time, one of the four, among those who had come out, was stoning from the sky, and gathering and taking away all the mighty stars, whose sexual organs were like the sexual organs of horses; then he bound all of them hand and foot, and cast them into the pits of the earth.",
      "89:1": "Then one of those four went to those snow-white bovids and taught (one of them) a secret: he was born a bovid but became a person; and he built for himself a big boat and dwelt upon it. Three cows dwelt together with him in that boat, and that boat was covered (over) them.",
      "89:2": "Again I raised my eyes toward heaven, and saw a lofty ceiling with seven cascading streams upon it; and those cascading streams flowed with much water into one enclosed area.",
      "89:3": "Again I saw, and behold, fountains were opened upon the ground of that great enclosed area, and the water began to swell and rise upon the ground; and I saw that enclosed area until the whole ground was (completely) covered with water.",
      "89:4": "Water, darkness, and mist accumulated heavily upon it; and I looked at the ascent of that water going up and up until it rose above that enclosed area, and was streaming above the enclosed area; thus it was standing above the ground.",
      "89:5": "And everything that was in the enclosed area; and (all those on the ground) were gathered together until I saw them sinking, being swallowed up, and perishing in that water.",
      "89:6": "Yet that boat was floating above the water, though all the cattle, elephants, camels, and donkeys were sinking to the bottom; so I could (no longer) see any one of the animals (for) they had no ability to come out but (only) to perish and sink into the deep water.",
      "89:7": "Again I kept seeing in the vision until those cascading streams were dissipated from that high ceiling, the fountains of the earth were normalized, and other pits were opened.",
      "89:8": "Then the water began to descend into them until the ground became visible, that boat settled upon the earth, the darkness vanished, and it became light.",
      "89:9": "Then the snow-white cow which became a man came out from that boat together with three cows. One of those three cows was snow-white, similar to that (first) cow, and one of them red like blood. Now that (first) snow-white cow departed from them.",
      "89:10": "Then they began to bear the beasts of the fields and the birds. There arose out of them all classes of population: lions, leopards, wolves, snakes, hyenas, wild boars, foxes, squirrels, swine, hawks, eagles, kites, striped crow(s), and ravens. Among them there was also born a snow-white cow.",
      "89:11": "Then they began to bite one another among themselves. That snow-white cow which was born in their midst begat a wild ass, and a snow-white cow with it; and the wild asses multiplied.",
      "89:12": "And that cow which was born from him bore a black wild boar and a snow-white sheep; the former then bore healthy beasts and the latter bore twelve sheep.",
      "89:13": "When those twelve sheep had grown up, they gave away one of their own members to the donkeys, which in turn gave him away to the wolves; so this sheep grew up in the midst of the wolves.",
      "89:14": "Then the Lord brought the eleven sheep to dwell with him, and to pasture in the midst of the wolves; and they multiplied and became many flocks of sheep.",
      "89:15": "Then the wolves began to fear them; so they tortured them until their little ones were being killed (for) they cast away their little ones into a river of great quantity of water. So those sheep began to cry aloud on behalf of their little ones and to complain unto their Lord.",
      "89:16": "Then one sheep which had been saved from the wolves fled and escaped to the wild asses. But I saw the sheep continuing to lament and cry aloud; and they kept praying to their Lord with all their strength until the Lord of the sheep descended at their entreatment, from a lofty palace, arriving to visit them.",
      "89:17": "He called that sheep which had escaped from the wolves and told him concerning the wolves that he should warn the wolves not to touch the sheep.",
      "89:18": "The sheep then went to the wolves in accordance with the word of the Lord, together with another sheep which he had met, so the two of them went on and arrived together into the assembly of those wolves, and spoke to them and warned them not to touch the sheep.",
      "89:19": "But thenceforth I saw how the wolves even intensified their pressure upon the sheep. They, the sheep, cried aloud—they cried aloud with all their strength.",
      "89:20": "Then their Lord came to (the rescue of) the sheep, whereupon they began to whip those wolves. So the wolves began to make lamentations, but the sheep thereafter became quiet and stopped crying aloud.",
      "89:21": "I continued to see the sheep until they departed from (the presence) of the wolves, and the wolves (until) their eyes were dazzled; yet the wolves went out to pursue those sheep, with all their might.",
      "89:22": "But the Lord of the sheep went with them as their leader, while all his sheep were following him; his face was glorious, adorable, and marvelous to behold.",
      "89:23": "As for the wolves, they continue to pursue those sheep until they found them at a certain pool of water.",
      "89:24": "Then the pool of water was rent asunder, and the water stood apart on this and on that side before their very eyes, and their Lord, their leader, stood between them and the wolves.",
      "89:25": "Those wolves were still not able to see the sheep, and (the sheep) walked through that pool of water; then the wolves followed the sheep and ran after them into that pool of water.",
      "89:26": "Then when they saw the Lord of the sheep, they turned in order to flee from before his face. But that pool of water gathered itself together and immediately returned to its normal state, the water became full and rose high until it covered (completely) those wolves.",
      "89:27": "Thus I saw till the wolves which pursued those sheep perished and were drowned.",
      "89:28": "So the sheep proceeded past that water and arrived in the desert, where there was no water or grass; but they began to open their eyes and see. Then I saw the Lord of the sheep bringing them to a pasture and giving them grass and water. Also that sheep was leading them as they were proceeding forward.",
      "89:29": "That sheep then ascended to the summit of that lofty rock; and the Lord of the sheep sent (him) to them",
      "89:30": "After that, I saw the Lord of the sheep, who stood before them; his appearance was majestic, marvelous, and powerful; all those sheep beheld him and were afraid before his face.",
      "89:31": "All of them feared and trembled because of him, and cried aloud to that sheep (who was) leading them and to the other sheep who was also in their midst, saying, “We are not able to stand before the presence of our Lord and to look at him.”",
      "89:32": "Then that sheep which was leading them turned back and (again) ascended to the summit of that rock; meanwhile the sheep began to be dim-sighted in their eyes, and went astray from the path which he had shown them; but that sheep was not aware of it.",
      "89:33": "So the Lord of the sheep became angry at them with great wrath; and that sheep became aware of it, and having descended from the summit of that rock, came to the sheep and found that the majority of them had been blinded in their eyes and gone astray.",
      "89:34": "And those who saw him became afraid, trembling in his presence, and wanted to return to their folds.",
      "89:35": "So that sheep took some other different sheep together with them and came to those sheep which had gone astray, slaying them; and the sheep became frightened in his presence. He, that sheep, thus caused those sheep which went astray to return, and brought them back into their folds.",
      "89:36": "I continued to see in that vision till that sheep was transformed into a man and built a house for the Lord of the sheep, and placed the sheep in it.",
      "89:37": "I, moreover, continued to see until that sheep, which had met the sheep that was their leader, fell asleep and all the senior sheep perished, junior ones rising to take their places. Then coming into a pasture, they approached a stream of water.",
      "89:38": "(There) that sheep who was leading them—the one who had become a man—departed from them, and all of them went to sleep. (Then the rest of) the sheep sought him; and there took place a great cry over him.",
      "89:39": "And I kept looking till they quieted down from crying for that sheep, crossed that stream of water, and all of the sheep stopped. Those who were leading them made agreements with those whom they found, and they led them.",
      "89:40": "I still kept seeing the sheep till they arrived at a very pleasant place and in a land beautiful and glorious; I saw those sheep being satiated; and that house was in their midst in the beautiful land, by which their eyes become opened.",
      "89:41": "And when their eyes become dim-sighted until another sheep arose and led them, they would all return and their eyes became opened.",
      "89:42": "Now the dogs, foxes, and the wild boars began to devour those sheep till the Lord of the sheep raised up another sheep, one from among them—a ram which would lead them.",
      "89:43": "That ram began to fight on all sides those dogs, foxes, and wild boars until he destroyed all of them.",
      "89:44": "Then that sheep had his eyes opened; and he saw that ram which was among the sheep, how he abandoned his own glory and began to attack those sheep, to trample upon them, and went away without dignity.",
      "89:45": "So the Lord of the sheep sent the sheep to another sheep and promoted him to become a ram and lead the sheep in place of that sheep which had abandoned his own glory.",
      "89:46": "After having gone to him, he spoke to him privately and raised that ram, making him a judge and a leader of the people—throughout (this time) the dogs were continuing to covet the sheep.",
      "89:47": "The first ram then persecuted that second ram, so that latter ram arose and escaped from before his (the former’s) presence; and then I continued to look until those dogs toppled that first sheep.",
      "89:48": "But that second ram arose and led the little sheep. That ram begat many sheep and fell asleep before a little sheep became a ram in his place, a judge and a leader of those sheep.",
      "89:49": "Those sheep grew and multiplied, but all those dogs, foxes, and wild boars feared and fled before him. That ram attacked and killed all the wild beasts; and all the wild beasts were no longer able to return among the sheep or to rob absolutely anything from them.",
      "89:50": "Then that house became great and spacious; a lofty building was built upon it for that sheep, as well as a tall and great tower upon if for the Lord of the sheep; that house was low but the tower was really elevated and lofty. Then the Lord of the sheep stood upon that tower, and they offered a full table before him.",
      "89:51": "Again I saw those sheep, how they went astray, going in diverse ways and abandoning that house of his. Then the Lord of the sheep called some from among the sheep and sent them to the sheep, but the sheep began to slay them.",
      "89:52": "However, one of them was not killed but escaped alive and fled away; he cried aloud to the sheep, and they wanted to kill him, but the Lord of the sheep rescued him from the sheep and caused him to ascend to me and settle down.",
      "89:53": "He sent many other sheep to those sheep to testify to them and to lament over them.",
      "89:54": "Thereafter I saw that, when they abandoned the house of the Lord and his tower, they went astray completely, and their eyes became blindfolded. Then I saw the Lord of the sheep, how he executed much slaughter upon them, in their flocks, until those sheep (began to) invoke that slaughter, and he vindicated his place.",
      "89:55": "He left them in the hands of the lions, leopards, and wolves, hyenas, as well as in the hands of the foxes and to all the wild beasts; and these wild beasts of the wilderness began to tear those sheep into pieces.",
      "89:56": "I saw how he left that house of theirs and that tower of theirs and cast all of them into the hands of the lions—(even) into the hands of all the wild beasts—so that they may tear them into pieces and eat them.",
      "89:57": "Then I began to cry aloud with all my strength and to call upon the Lord of the lions and to reveal to him concerning the sheep, for he had fed them to all the wild beasts.",
      "89:58": "But he remained quiet and happy because they were being devoured, swallowed, and snatched; so he abandoned them into the hands of all the wild beasts for food.",
      "89:59": "He then summoned seventy shepherds and surrendered those sheep to them so that they might pasture them. He spoke to the shepherds and their colleagues, “From now on, let each and every one of you graze the sheep; and do everything which I command you.",
      "89:60": "I shall hand them over to you duly counted and tell you which among them are to be destroyed; and you shall destroy them!”",
      "89:61": "So he handed over those sheep to them. Then calling another (group of shepherds), he told them, “Take notice and see everything which the shepherds will do to those sheep; for they will destroy from among them a greater number than those which I have commanded them.",
      "89:62": "You write down every excess and destruction that will be wrought through the shepherds—how many they destroy according to my command, and how many they will destroy of their own accord! Write down every destruction that each and every shepherd causes, against their records!",
      "89:63": "And read aloud before me each particular case—how many they destroy and how many they give over to destruction—so that this may become a testimony for me against them, so that I may know all the deeds of the shepherds, (and) so that I may evaluate them and see what they do, whether they act according to my command which I have commanded them or not.",
      "89:64": "If they do not know it, do not reveal it to them, neither admonish them, but write down every destruction caused by the shepherds—for each and every one in his appointed time—and elevate all of it to me.”",
      "89:65": "And I saw till those shepherds in their appointed time pastured (the sheep) and began killing and destroying many in excess of what they had been commanded; and they abandoned those sheep into the hands of the lions.",
      "89:66": "So the lions and the leopards ate and devoured the majority of those sheep; the wild boars also ate along with them. Then they burned that tower and plowed that house.",
      "89:67": "And I became exceedingly sorrowful on account of that tower, for that house of the sheep was being plowed; thereafter I was unable to see whether those sheep could enter that house.",
      "89:68": "So the shepherds and their colleagues handed over those sheep to all the wild beasts so that they might devour them. At the appointed time, each one among them (the shepherds) receives (the sheep) in a fixed number; and each one among them (the shepherds) hands them (the sheep) over to the other (the colleague) in a fixed number. (then) they shall write down for the other (the colleague) in a book how many among them (the sheep) would perish.",
      "89:69": "Each and every one of them kills and destroys in excess of their order. So I began to weep and cry aloud on account of those sheep.",
      "89:70": "In this manner I saw that writer in my vision—how he writes down that which was destroyed by those shepherds, every day, and (how) he elevates, puts down, and shows the whole book to the Lord of the sheep; everything that each one has done; everything that each and every one of them has eliminated; and everything that they have given over to destruction.",
      "89:71": "The book was read before the Lord of the sheep; and he took it from his hand, read it, sealed it, and laid it down.",
      "89:72": "Thereafter I saw the shepherds pasturing for twelve hours: behold, three of those sheep returning, arriving, entering, and beginning to build all (the parts) of that house which had fallen down! The wild boars came and tried to hinder them but were unsuccessful.",
      "89:73": "They again began to build as before; and they raised up that tower which is called the high tower. But they started to place a table before the tower, with all the food which is upon it being polluted and impure.",
      "89:74": "Regarding all these matters, the eyes of the sheep became so dim-sighted that they could not see—and likewise in respect to their shepherds—and they were delivered to their shepherds for an excessive destruction, so that the sheep were trampled upon and eaten.",
      "89:75": "The Lord of the sheep remained silent until all the sheep were dispersed into the woods and got mixed among the wild beasts,—and could not be rescued from the hands of the beasts.",
      "89:76": "The one who was writing a book elevated and showed it and read the grave words of the Lord of the sheep. He then pleaded to him and begged him on account of the sheep, while manifesting to him all the deeds of the shepherds and giving testimony before him against all the shepherds.",
      "89:77": "Then taking it, he placed that very book beside him in this manner and departed.",
      "90:1": "Then I saw after that how thirty-seven shepherds were pasturing (the sheep); all of them completed (their duties) in their own respective periods, like the former ones; and aliens took (the sheep) into their hands in order to pasture them in their own respective periods—each shepherd in his own period.",
      "90:2": "After that I saw with my own eyes all the birds of heaven—eagles, vultures, kites, and ravens—coming; the eagles were the ones who were leading all the birds; and they began to eat those sheep, to dig out their eyes, and to eat their flesh.",
      "90:3": "Then the sheep cried aloud, for their flesh was being eaten by the birds. I, too, cried aloud and lamented in my sleep on account of that shepherd who was grazing the sheep.",
      "90:4": "I kept seeing till those sheep were eaten by the dogs, the eagles, and the kites; and they left neither flesh, nor skin, nor sinew on them absolutely, until their bones stood there bare; then their bones fell to the ground, and the sheep became few.",
      "90:5": "I kept seeing till twenty-three shepherds pastured (the sheep), and all of them completed fifty-eight seasons in their own respective periods.",
      "90:6": "Then, behold lambs were born from those snow-white sheep; and they began to open their eyes and see, and cried aloud to the sheep.",
      "90:7": "But as for the sheep, they (the Iambs) cried aloud to them, yet they (the sheep) did not listen to what they (the lambs) were telling them but became exceedingly deafened, and their eyes became exceedingly dim-sighted.",
      "90:8": "Then I saw in a vision ravens flying above those lambs, and they seized one of those lambs; and then smashing the sheep, they ate them.",
      "90:9": "I kept seeing till those lambs grew horns; but the ravens crushed their horns. Then I kept seeing till one great horn sprouted on one of those sheep, and he opened their eyes; and they had vision in them and their eyes were opened.",
      "90:10": "He cried aloud to the sheep, and all the rams saw him and ran unto him.",
      "90:11": "In spite of this, all those eagles, vultures, ravens, and kites until now continue to rip the sheep, swooping down upon them and eating them. As for the sheep, they remain silent; but the rams are lamenting and crying aloud.",
      "90:12": "Those ravens gather and battle with him (the horned ram) and seek to remove his horn, but without any success.",
      "90:13": "I saw thereafter the shepherds coming; and those vultures and kites cried aloud to the ravens so that they should smash the horn of that ram. But he battled with them, and they fought each other; and he cried aloud, while battling with them, so that (God’s) help should come.",
      "90:14": "I kept seeing till that man, who writes down the names of the shepherds and elevates them before the Lord of the sheep, came; it is he who helped him and revealed (to him) everything; thus help came down for that is ram.",
      "90:15": "And I kept seeing till the Lord of the sheep came upon them in wrath, and all who saw him fled and fell all into darkness, from before his face.",
      "90:16": "All the eagles, vultures, ravens, and kites gathered, with all the sheep of the field lining up with them; and having thus come together in unity, all of them cooperated in order to smash the horn of the ram.",
      "90:17": "I saw that man who was writing a book by the command of the Lord, for he opened that book (of) the destruction which those twelve last shepherds caused; and he revealed before the Lord of the sheep that they had much is greater destruction than their predecessors.",
      "90:18": "I kept seeing till the Lord of the sheep came unto them and took in his hand the rod of his wrath and smote the earth; and all the beasts and all the birds of the heaven fell down from the midst of those sheep and were swallowed up in the earth, and it was covered upon them.",
      "90:19": "Then I saw that a great sword was given to the sheep; and the sheep proceeded against all the beasts of the field in order to kill them; and all the beasts and birds of heaven fled from before their face.",
      "90:20": "Then I kept seeing till a throne was erected in a pleasant land; and he sat upon if for the Lord of the sheep; and he took all the sealed books and opened those very books in the presence of the Lord of the sheep.",
      "90:21": "Then the Lord called those people, the seven first snow-white ones, and ordered them to bring before him (some) from among the first star(s) that arose, and from among those stars whose sexual organs were like those of the horses, as well as (that) first star which had fallen down earlier. And they brought them all before him.",
      "90:22": "He spoke to the man who was writing in his presence—that (man) being one of those seven snow-white ones—saying, “Take those seven shepherds to whom I had handed over the sheep, but who decided to kill many more than they were ordered.”",
      "90:23": "Behold, I saw all of them bound; and they all stood before him.",
      "90:24": "Then his judgment took place. First among the stars, they received their judgment and were found guilty, and they went to the place of condemnation; and they were thrown into an abyss, full of fire and flame and full of the pillar of fire.",
      "90:25": "Then those seventy shepherds were judged and found guilty; and they were cast into that fiery abyss.",
      "90:26": "In the meantime I saw how another abyss like it, full of fire, was opened wide in the middle of the ground; and they brought those blinded sheep, all of which were judged, found guilty, and cast into this fiery abyss, and they were burned—the abyss is to the right of that house;",
      "90:27": "thus I saw those sheep while they were burning—their bones also were burning.",
      "90:28": "Then I stood still, looking at that ancient house being transformed: All the pillars and all the columns were pulled out; and the ornaments of that house were packed and taken out together with them and abandoned in a certain place in the South of the land.",
      "90:29": "I went on seeing until the Lord of the sheep brought about a new house, greater and loftier than the first one, and set it up in the first location which had been covered up—all its pillars were new, the columns new; and the ornaments new as well as greater than those of the first, (that is) the old (house) which was gone. All the sheep were within it.",
      "90:30": "Then I saw all the sheep that had survived as well as all the animals upon the earth and the birds of heaven, falling down and worshiping those sheep, making petition to them and obeying them in every respect.",
      "90:31": "Thereafter, those three who were wearing snow-white (clothes), the former ones who had caused me to go up, grabbed me by my hand—also the hand of that ram holding me—and I ascended; they set me down in the midst of those sheep prior to the occurrence of this judgment.",
      "90:32": "Those sheep were all snow-white, and their wool considerable and clean.",
      "90:33": "All those which have been destroyed and dispersed, and all the beasts of the field and the birds of the sky were gathered together in that house; and the Lord of the sheep rejoiced with great joy because they had all become gentle and returned to his house.",
      "90:34": "I went on seeing until they had laid down that sword which was given to the sheep; they returned it to the house and sealed it in the presence of the Lord. All the sheep were invited to that house but it could not contain them (all).",
      "90:35": "The eyes of all of them were opened, and they saw the beautiful things; not a single one existed among them that could not see.",
      "90:36": "Also I noticed that the house was large, wide, and exceedingly full.",
      "90:37": "Then I saw that a snow-white cow was born, with huge horns; all the beasts of the field and all the birds of the sky feared him and made petition to him all the time.",
      "90:38": "I went on seeing until all their kindred were transformed, and became snow-white cows; and the first among them became something, and that something became a great beast with huge black horns on its head. The Lord of the sheep rejoiced over it and over all the cows.",
      "90:39": "I myself became satiated in their midst. Then I woke up and saw everything.",
      "90:40": "This is the vision which I saw while I was sleeping. Then I woke up and blessed the Lord of righteousness and gave him glory.",
      "90:41": "And I wept with a great weeping, and my tears could not stop, till I had no more endurance left, but flowed down on account of what I had seen until everything should come and be fulfilled. The deeds of the people were also shown to me, each according to its type.",
      "90:42": "On that night I remembered the first dream and wept on its account, and I was restless because I had (just) seen that vision.",
      "91:1": "Now, my son Methuselah, (please) summon all your brothers on my behalf, and gather together to me all the sons of your mother; for a voice calls me, and the spirit is poured over me so that I may show you everything that shall happen to you forever.",
      "91:2": "Then Methuselah went and summoned his brothers, and having summoned them to him, gathered his family together.",
      "91:3": "Then he (Enoch) spoke to all of them, children of righteousness, and said, “Hear, all you children of Enoch, the talk of your father and listen to my voice in uprightness;",
      "91:4": "for I exhort you, (my) beloved, and say to you: Love uprightness, and it alone. Do not draw near uprightness with an ambivalent attitude, and neither associate with hypocrites. But walk in righteousness, my children, and it shall lead you in the good paths; and righteousness shall be your friend.",
      "91:5": "For I know that the state of violence will intensify upon the earth; a great plague shall be executed upon the earth; all (forms of) oppression will be carried out; and everything shall be uprooted; and every arrow shall fly fast.",
      "91:6": "Oppression shall recur once more and be carried out upon the earth; every (form of) oppression, injustice, and iniquity shall infect (the world) twofold.",
      "91:7": "When sin, oppression, blasphemy, and injustice increase, crime, iniquity, and uncleanliness shall be committed and increase (likewise). Then a great plague shall take place from heaven upon all these; the holy Lord shall emerge with wrath and plague in order that he may execute judgment upon the earth.",

      "108:8": "Those who love God have loved neither gold nor silver, nor all the good things which are in the world, but have given over their bodies to suffering—",
      "108:9": "who from the time of their very being have not longed after earthly food, and who regarded themselves as a (mere) passing breath. And they have observed this matter, the Lord having put them through much testing; then he received their pure spirits so that they should bless his name.",
      "108:10": "And I have recounted in the books all their blessings. He has caused them to be recompensed, for they were all found loving God more than the fire of their eternal souls; and while they were being trodden upon by evil people, experiencing abuse and insult by them, they continued blessing us.",
      "108:11": "So now I shall summon their spirits if they are born of light, and change those who are born in darkness—those whose bodies were not recompensed with honor as they deserved for their faithfulness.",
      "108:12": "I shall bring them out into the bright light, those who have loved my holy name, and seat them each one by one upon the throne of his honor;",
      "108:13": "and they shall be resplendent for ages that cannot be numbered; for the judgment of God is righteousness, because he will give faith—as well as the paths of truth—to the faithful ones in the resting place.",
      "108:14": "Then they shall see those who were born in darkness being taken into darkness, while the righteous ones shall is be resplendent.",
      "108:15": "(The sinners) shall cry aloud, and they shall see the righteous ones being resplendent; they shall go to the place which was prescribed for them concerning the days and the seasons.” Here ends the Revelation of the Secrets of Enoch."

And all of them were assembled together, and they were sitting and weeping at Abel-Main, which is between Lebanon and Senir, covering their faces. 10 And I recited in their presence all the visions that I had seen in the dream, and I began to speak the words of truth and the vision and reprimand to the watchers of heaven.",
      "14:1": "The Book of the Words of Truth and the Reprimand of the Watchers Who Were from of Old, according to the command of the Great Holy One <in the dream that I dreamed>. 2 In this vision I saw in my dream what I now speak with a human tongue and with the breath of my mouth, which the Great One has given to humans, to speak with them and to understand with the heart. 3 As he created and destined humans to understand the words of knowledge, so he created and destined me to reprimand the watchers, the sons of heaven.",
      "14:4": "I wrote up your petition, and in the vision it was shown to me thus, that you will not obtain your petition for all the days of eternity; but judgment has been consummated in the decree against you,",
      "14:5": "that from now on you will not ascend into heaven for all the ages; and it has been decreed to bind you in bonds in the earth for all the days of eternity.",

      "14:7": "Accordingly, you will not obtain your petition concerning them, nor concerning yourselves. You will be petitioning and making supplication; . . . but you will not be speaking any word from the writing that I have written.",
      "14:8": "In the vision it was shown to me thus: Look, clouds in the vision were summoning me, and mists were crying out to me; and shooting stars and lightning flashes were hastening me and speeding me along, and winds in my vision made me fly up and lifted me upward and brought me to heaven.",
      "14:9": "And I went in until I drew near to a wall built of hailstones; and tongues of fire were encircling them all around, and they began to frighten me.",
      "14:10": "And I went into the tongues of fire, and I drew near to a great house built of hailstones; and the walls of this house were like stone slabs, and they were all of snow, and the floor was of snow.",
      "14:11": "And the ceiling was like shooting stars and lightning flashes; and among them were fiery cherubim, and their heaven was water,",

      "14:14": "and I was quaking and trembling, and I fell upon my face. And I saw in my vision,",
      "14:15": "And look, another open door before me: and a house greater than the former one, and it was all built of tongues of fire.",
      "14:16": "All of it so excelled in glory and splendor and majesty that I am unable to describe for you its glory and majesty.",
      "14:17": "Its floor was of fire, and its upper part was flashes of lightning and shooting stars, and its ceiling was a flaming fire.",
      "14:18": "And I was looking and I saw a lofty throne; and its appearance was like ice, and its wheels were like the shining sun, and the voice (or sound) of the cherubim,",
      "14:19": "and from beneath the throne issued rivers of flaming fire. And I was unable to see.",
      "14:20": "The Great Glory sat upon it; his apparel was like the appearance of the sun and whiter than much snow.",

      "14:22": "Flaming fire encircled him and a great fire stood by him, and none of those about him approached him. Ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him, but he needed no counselor; his every word was deed.",
      "14:23": "And the holy ones of the watchers who approached him did not depart by night, nor <by day> did they leave him.",
      "14:24": "Until now I had been on my face, prostrate and trembling. And the Lord called me with his mouth and said to me, “Come here, Enoch, and hear my word(s).” 25 And one of the holy ones came to me and raised me up and stood me (on my feet) and brought me up to the door. But I had my face bowed down.",
      "15:1": "But he answered and said to me—and I heard his voice— “Fear not, Enoch, righteous man and scribe of truth; come here, and hear my voice.",
      "15:2": "Go and say to the watchers of heaven, who sent you to petition in their behalf, ‘You should petition in behalf of humans, and not humans in behalf of you.",
      "15:3": "Why have you forsaken the high heaven, the eternal sanctuary; and lain with women, and defiled yourselves with the daughters of men; and taken for yourselves wives, and done as the sons of earth; and begotten for yourselves sons, giants?",
      "15:4": "You were holy ones and spirits, living forever. With the blood of women you have defiled yourselves, and with the blood of flesh you have begotten, and with the blood of men you have lusted, and you have done as they do— flesh and blood, who die and perish.",
      "15:5": "Therefore I gave them women, that they might cast seed into them, and thus beget children by them, that nothing fail them on the earth.",
      "15:6": "But you originally existed as spirits, living forever, and not dying for all the generations of eternity;",
      "15:7": "therefore I did not make women among you.’ The spirits of heaven, in heaven is their dwelling;",
      "15:8": "But now the giants who were begotten by the spirits and flesh— they will call them evil spirits on the earth, for their dwelling will be on the earth.",
      "15:9": "The spirits that have gone forth from the body of their flesh are evil spirits, for from humans they came into being, and from the holy watchers was the origin of their creation. Evil spirits they will be on the earth, and evil spirits they will be called.",
      "15:10": "The spirits of heaven, in heaven is their dwelling; but the spirits begotten on the earth, on the earth is their dwelling.",
      "15:11": "And the spirits of the giants <lead astray>, do violence, make desolate, and attack and wrestle and hurl upon the earth and <cause illnesses>. They eat nothing, but abstain from food and are thirsty and smite.",
      "15:12": "These spirits (will) rise up against the sons of men and against the women, for they have come forth from them.",
      "16:1": "From the day of the slaughter and destruction and death of the giants, from the soul of whose flesh the spirits are proceeding, they are making desolate without (incurring) judgment. Thus they will make desolate until the day of the consummation of the great judgment, when the great age will be consummated. It will be consummated all at once.",
      "16:2": "And now (say) to the watchers who sent you to petition in their behalf, who formerly were in heaven,",
      "16:3": "‘You were in heaven, and no mystery was revealed to you; but a stolen mystery you learned; and this you made known to the women in your hardness of heart; and through this mystery the women and men are multiplying evils on the earth.’",
      "16:4": "Say to them, ‘You will have no peace.’”",

      "17:2": "And they led me away to a dark place and to a mountain whose summit reached to heaven.",
      "17:3": "And I saw the place of the luminaries and the treasuries of the stars and of the thunders, and to the depths of the ether, where the bow of fire and the arrows and their quivers (were) and the sword of fire and all the lightnings.",
      "17:4": "And they led me away to the living waters and to the fire of the west, which provides all the sunsets.",
      "17:5": "And I came to the river of fire, in which fire flows down like water and discharges into the great sea of the west.",
      "17:6": "I saw all the great rivers. And I arrived at the great river and the great darkness. And I departed (for) where no human walks. 7 I saw the wintry winds of darkness and the gushing of all the waters of the abyss. 8 I saw the mouth of all the rivers of the earth and the mouth of the abyss.",
      "18:1": "I saw the treasuries of all the winds. I saw how through them he ordered all created things.",
      "18:2": "I saw the foundation of the earth and the cornerstone of the earth. I saw the four winds bearing the earth and the firmament of heaven. 3 And I saw how the winds stretch out the height of heaven. They stand between earth and heaven; they are the pillars of heaven.",
      "18:4": "I saw the winds of heaven that turn and bring to (their) setting the disk of the sun and all the stars.",
      "18:5": "I saw the winds on the earth bearing the clouds. I saw the paths of the angels. I saw at the ends of the earth the firmament of heaven above.",
      "18:6": "I came and saw a place that was burning night and day, where (there were) seven mountains of precious stones—three lying to the east and three to the south.",
      "18:7": "And of those to the east, (one was) of colored stone, and one was of pearl, and one was of <jasper>. And those to the south were of flame-colored stone.",
      "18:8": "And the middle one of them reached to heaven like the throne of God—of antimony; and the top of the throne was of lapis lazuli.",
      "18:9": "And I saw a burning fire.",
      "18:10": "And beyond these mountains is a place, the edge of the great earth; there the heavens come to an end.  11 And I saw a great chasm among pillars of heavenly fire. And I saw in it pillars of fire descending; and they were immeasurable toward the depth and toward the height.",
      "19:1": "And Uriel said to me, “There stand the angels who mingled with the women. And their spirits—having assumed many forms—bring destruction on men and lead them astray to sacrifice to demons as to gods until the day of the great judgment, in which they will be judged with finality.",
      "19:2": "And the wives of the transgressing angels will become sirens.”",
      "18:12": "Beyond this chasm I saw a place where there was neither firmament of heaven above, nor firmly founded earth beneath it. Neither was there water on it, nor bird; but the place was desolate and fearful.",
      "18:13": "There I saw seven stars like great burning mountains.",
      "18:14": "To me, when I inquired about them, the angel said, “This place is the end of heaven and earth; this has become a prison for the stars and the hosts of heaven.",
      "18:15": "The stars that are rolling over in the fire, these are they that transgressed the command of the Lord in the beginning of their rising, for they did not come out in their appointed times.",

      "21:1": "I traveled to where it was chaotic.",
      "21:2": "And there I saw a terrible thing; I saw neither heaven above, nor firmly founded earth, but a chaotic and terrible place.",
      "21:3": "And there I saw seven of the stars of heaven, bound and thrown in it together, like great mountains, and burning in fire.",
      "21:4": "Then I said, “For what reason have they been bound, and for what reason have they been thrown here?”",
      "21:5": "Then Uriel said to me, one of the holy angels who was with me, and he was their leader, he said to me, “Enoch, why do you inquire, and why are you eager for the truth?",

      "21:7": "From there I traveled to another place, more terrible than this one. And I saw terrible things—a great fire burning and flaming there. And the place had a narrow cleft (extending) to the abyss, full of great pillars of fire, borne downward. Neither the measure nor the size was I able to see or to estimate.",
      "21:8": "Then I said, “How terrible is this place and fearful to look at!”",
      "21:9": "Then Uriel answered me, one of the holy angels who was with me, and said to me, “Enoch, why are you so frightened and shaken?” And I replied, “Because of this terrible place and because of the fearful sight.”",
      "21:10": "And he said, “This place is a prison for the angels. Here they will be confined forever.”",
      "22:1": "From there I traveled to another place. And he showed me to the west a great and high mountain of hard rock.",
      "22:2": "And there were four hollow places in it, deep and very smooth. Three of them were dark and one, illuminated; and a fountain of water was in the middle of it. And I said, “How smooth are these hollows and altogether deep and dark to view.”",
      "22:3": "Then Raphael answered me, one of the holy angels who was with me, and said to me, “These hollow places (are intended) that the spirits of the souls of the dead might be gathered into them. For this very (purpose) they were created, (that) here the souls of all human beings should be gathered.",
      "22:4": "And look, these are the pits for the place of their confinement. Thus they were made until the day (on) which they will be judged, and until the time of the day of the end of the great judgment that will be exacted from them.”",
      "22:5": "There I saw the spirit of a dead man making suit, and his lamentation went up to heaven and cried and made suit.",
      "22:6": "Then I asked Raphael, the watcher and holy one who was with me, and said to him, “This spirit that makes suit—whose is it—that thus his lamentation goes up and makes suit unto heaven?”",
      "22:7": "And he answered me and said, “This is the spirit that went forth from Abel, whom Cain his brother murdered. And Abel makes accusation against him until his posterity perishes from the face of the earth, and his posterity is obliterated from the posterity of men.”",
      "22:8": "Then I asked about all the hollow places, why they were separated one from the other.",
      "22:9": "And he answered me and said, “These three were made that the spirits of the dead might be separated. And this has been separated for the spirits of the righteous, where the bright fountain of water is.",
      "22:10": "And this has been created for <the spirits of the> sinners, when they die and are buried in the earth, and judgment has not been executed on them in their life.",
      "22:11": "Here their spirits are separated for this great torment, until the great day of judgment, of scourges and tortures of the cursed forever, that there might be a recompense for their spirits. There he will bind them forever.",
      "22:12": "And this has been separated for the spirits of them that make suit, who make disclosure about the destruction, when they were murdered in the days of the sinners.",
      "22:13": "And this was created for the spirits of the people who will not be pious, but sinners, who were godless, and they were companions with the lawless. And their spirits will not be punished on the day of judgment, nor will they be raised from there.”",
      "22:14": "Then I blessed the Lord of glory and said, “Blessed is the judgment of righteousness and blessed are you, O Lord of majesty and righteousness, who are Lord of eternity.”",
      "23:1": "And from there I traveled to another place, to the west of the ends of the earth. 2 And I saw a fire that ran and did not rest or quit its course day and night, but continued.",
      "23:3": "And I asked and said, “What is this that has no rest?”",
      "23:4": "Then Reuel answered me, one of the holy angels who was with me, and said to me, “This course of fire is the fire of the west, which pursues all the luminaries of heaven.”",
      "24:1": "And he showed me mountains of fire that burned day and night.",
      "24:2": "And I proceeded beyond them, and I saw seven glorious mountains, all differing each from the other, whose stones were precious in beauty. And all (the mountains) were precious and glorious and beautiful in appearance—three to the east were firmly set one on the other, and three to the south, one on the other, and deep and rugged ravines, one not approaching the other.",
      "24:3": "The seventh mountain (was) in the middle of these, and it rose above them in height, like the seat of a throne. And fragrant trees encircled it.",
      "24:4": "Among them was a tree such as I had never smelled, and among them was no other like it. It had a fragrance sweeter smelling than all spices, and its leaves and its blossom and the tree never wither. Its fruit is beautiful, like dates of the palm trees.",
      "24:5": "Then I said, “How beautiful is this tree and fragrant, and its leaves are lovely, and its blossoms are lovely to look at.”",
      "24:6": "Then Michael answered me, one of the holy angels who was with me and was their leader,",
      "25:1": "and he said to me, “Enoch, why do you inquire and why do you marvel about the fragrance of this tree, and why do you wish to learn the truth?”",
      "25:2": "Then I answered him—I, Enoch—and said, “Concerning all things I wish to know, but especially concerning this tree.”",
      "25:3": "And he answered me and said, “This high mountain that you saw, whose peak is like the throne of God, is the seat where the Great Holy One, the Lord of glory, the King of eternity, will sit, when he descends to visit the earth in goodness.",
      "25:4": "And (as for) this fragrant tree, no flesh has the right to touch it until the great judgment, in which there will be vengeance on all and a consummation forever. Then it will be given to the righteous and the pious,",
      "25:5": "and its fruit will be food for the chosen. And it will be transplanted to the holy place, by the house of God, the King of eternity.",
      "25:6": "Then they will rejoice greatly and be glad, and they will enter into the sanctuary. Its fragrances <will be> in their bones, and they will live a long life on the earth, such as your fathers lived also in their days, and torments and plagues and suffering will not touch them.”",
      "25:7": "Then I blessed the God of glory, the King of eternity, who has prepared such things for people (who are) righteous, and has created them and promised to give (them) to them.",
      "26:1": "And from there I proceeded to the center of the earth, and I saw a blessed place where there were trees that had branches that abide and sprout.",
      "26:2": "And there I saw a holy mountain. From beneath the mountain water (came) from the east, and it flowed toward the south.",
      "26:3": "And I saw to the east another mountain higher than it, and between them a deep valley that had no breadth, and through it water was flowing beneath the mountain.",
      "26:4": "And to the west of this, another mountain lower than it and not rising very high, and a deep and dry valley beneath it, between them, and another deep and dry valley, at the apex of the three mountains.",
      "26:5": "And all the valleys were deep, of hard rock, and no tree was planted on them.",
      "26:6": "And I marveled at the mountain, and I marveled at the valley, I marveled exceedingly.",
      "27:1": "Then I said, “Why is this land blessed and all filled with trees, but this valley is cursed?”",
      "27:2": "Then <Sariel> answered, one of the holy angels who was with me, and said to me, “This cursed valley is for those who are cursed forever. Here will be gathered all the cursed, who utter with their mouth an improper word against the Lord and speak hard things against his glory. Here they will be gathered, and here will be (their) habitation",
      "27:3": "at the last times, in the days of righteous judgment in the presence of the righteous for all time. Here the godless will bless the Lord of glory, the King of eternity.",

      "27:5": "Then I blessed the Lord of glory, and his glory I made known and praised magnificently.",
      "28:1": "And from there I went to the midst of the mountain range of the desert. And I saw it desolate, and it alone was full of trees <and plants>.",

      "28:3": "Flowing like a copious watercourse, approximately to the northwest, it brought water and also dew from all around.",
      "29:1": "From there I went to another place in the desert, and I departed to the east of this mountain range.",
      "29:2": "I saw trees <of the field> breathing fragrances of frankincense and myrrh, and their trees were like nut trees.",
      "30:1": "Beyond these I departed far to the east. And I saw another vast place—valleys of water,",
      "30:2": "in which were aromatic cane like reeds.",
      "30:3": "On the banks of these valleys I saw the fragrant cinnamon.",
      "31:1": "Beyond these valleys, I departed to the east. And I saw other mountains, and also on them I saw trees, from which flowed the nectar called storax and galbanum.",
      "31:2": "Beyond these mountains I was shown another mountain, and on it were aloe trees. All the trees were full of . . . . . . . . , and it was like the bark of the almond tree.",
      "31:3": "When they grind this bark, it is sweeter than any perfume.",
      "32:1": "Beyond these mountains, approximately to their northeastern side I saw other mountains, filled with choice nard and tspr and cardamom and pepper.",
      "32:2": "From there I proceeded to the east of all these mountains, far from them to the east of the earth. And I passed over the Red Sea and departed far from it. And I crossed over the darkness, far from it.",
      "32:3": "I passed by the paradise of righteousness, and I saw from afar trees more plentiful and larger than these trees, differing from those—very large <and> beautiful and glorious and magnificent—and the tree of wisdom, whose fruit the holy ones eat and learn great wisdom.",
      "32:4": "That tree is in height like the fir, and its leaves, like (those of) the carob, and its fruit like the clusters of the vine—very cheerful; and its fragrance penetrates far beyond the tree.",
      "32:5": "Then I said, “How beautiful is the tree and how pleasing in appearance.”",
      "32:6": "Then <Gabriel>, the holy angel who was with me, answered, “This is the tree of wisdom from which your father of old and your mother of old, who were before you, ate and learned wisdom. And their eyes were opened, and they knew that they were naked, and they were driven from the garden.”",
      "33:1": "And from there I proceeded to the ends of the earth, and I saw there great beasts, and they differed each from the other; and birds also, differing (in) their appearance and their beauty and their voices, differed each from the other. To the east of these beasts I saw the ends of the earth, on which the heaven rests, and the gates of heaven open.",
      "33:2": "I saw how the stars of heaven come forth, and I counted the gates from which they emerge,",
      "33:3": "and I wrote down all their outlets, one by one, according to their number and their names, according to their conjunction and their position and their time and their months, as Uriel, the holy angel who was with me, showed me.",
      "33:4": "He showed me and wrote down for me everything, and also he wrote down their names and their appointed times and their functions.",
      "34:1": "And from there I proceeded to the north, at the ends of the earth, and there I saw great and glorious wonders at the ends of the whole earth.",
      "34:2": "There I saw three gates of heaven open in heaven. From them the winds in the north emerge. When they blow, (there is) cold and hail and hoarfrost and snow and dew and rain.",
      "34:3": "Through one gate they blow for good, and when they blow through two of the gates, they blow with violence, and there is affliction on the earth.",
      "35:1": "From there I proceeded toward the west, at the ends of the earth, and I saw there three gates of heaven open, as I saw in the east, the same number of gates and the same number of outlets.",
      "36:1": "From there I proceeded toward the south, at the ends of the earth, and there I saw three gates of heaven open, and from there the south wind and dew and rain emerge.",
      "36:2": "From there I proceeded toward the east, at the ends of the earth, and there I saw three gates of heaven open toward the east and above them, small gates.",
      "36:3": "Through each of these small gates pass the stars of heaven, and they proceed westward on the path that is shown them.",
      "36:4": "And when I saw, I blessed—and I shall always bless—the Lord of glory, who has wrought great and glorious wonders, to show his great deeds to his angels and to the spirits of human beings, so that they might see the work of his might and glorify the deeds of his hands and bless him forever.",
      "37:1": "The vision of wisdom that Enoch saw—the son of Jared, the son of Mahalalel, the son of Kenan, the son of Enosh, the son of Seth, the son of Adam.",
      "37:2": "This is the beginning of the words of wisdom, which I took up to recount to those who dwell on the earth. Listen, O ancients, and look, you who come after— the words of the Holy One, which I speak in the presence of the Lord of Spirits.",
      "37:3": "It is profitable to speak these things at first, and from those who come after, let us not withhold the beginning of wisdom.",
      "37:4": "Until now there had not been given from the presence of the Lord of Spirits such wisdom as I have received according to my insight, according to the good pleasure of the Lord of Spirits, by whom the lot of everlasting life was given to me.",
      "37:5": "Three parables were (imparted) to me, and I took (them) up and spoke to those who dwell on the earth.",

      "38:6": "and from then on, no one will seek mercy for them from the Lord of Spirits, for their life will be at an end.",
      "39:1": "In those days, sons of the chosen and holy were descending from the highest heaven, and their seed was becoming one with the sons of men.",
      "39:2": "In those days Enoch received books of jealous wrath and rage and books of trepidation and consternation.",
      "39:3": "And in those days a whirlwind snatched me up from the face of the earth and set me down within the confines of the heavens.",
      "39:4": "And there I saw another vision—the dwellings of the holy ones, and the resting places of the righteous.",
      "39:5": "There my eyes saw their dwellings with his righteous angels and their resting places with the holy ones. And they were petitioning and interceding and were praying for the sons of men. And righteousness was flowing like water before them, and mercy like dew upon the earth; thus it is among them forever and ever.",
      "39:6": "And in that place my eyes saw the Chosen One of righteousness and faith, and righteousness will be his days, and the righteous and chosen will be without number before him forever and ever.",
      "39:7": "And I saw his dwelling beneath the wings of the Lord of Spirits, and all the righteous and chosen were mighty before him like fiery lights. And their mouths were full of blessing, and their lips praised the name of the Lord of Spirits. And righteousness did not fail before him, nor did truth fail before him.",
      "39:8": "There I wished to dwell, and my spirit longed for that dwelling. There my lot had been before, for thus it has been established concerning me in the ­presence of the Lord of Spirits.",
      "39:9": "In those days I praised and exalted the name of the Lord of Spirits with blessing and praise, for he has established me for blessing and praise according to the good pleasure of the Lord of Spirits.",
      "39:10": "And for a long time, my eyes looked at that place, and I blessed him and praised him, saying, “Blessed is he, and may he be blessed from the beginning and forever.”",
      "39:11": "In his presence there is no limit; He knew before the age was created what would be forever, and for all the generations that will be.",
      "39:12": "Those who sleep not bless you, and they stand in the presence of your glory; And they bless and praise and exalt, saying, “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of Spirits, he fills the earth with spirits.”",
      "39:13": "And there my eyes saw all who sleep not; they stand in his presence, and they bless and say, “Blessed are you, and blessed is the name of the Lord forever and ever.”",
      "39:14": "And my face was changed, for I was unable to see.",
      "40:1": "And after this I saw thousands of thousands and ten thousand times ten thousand —they were innumerable and incalculable— who were standing in the presence of the glory of the Lord of Spirits.",
      "40:2": "I looked, and on the four sides of the Lord of Spirits, I saw four figures different from those who sleep not. And I learned their names, because the angel who went with me and showed me all the hidden things made their names known to me.",
      "40:3": "And I heard the voices of those four figures uttering praise in the presence of the Lord of Glory.",
      "40:4": "The first voice blesses the Lord of Spirits forever and ever.",
      "40:5": "And the second voice I heard blessing the Chosen One and the chosen ones who depend on the Lord of Spirits.",
      "40:6": "And the third voice I heard petitioning and praying for those who dwell on the earth, and interceding in the name of the Lord of Spirits.",
      "40:7": "And the fourth voice I heard driving away the satans, and he did not let them come before the Lord of Spirits, to accuse those who dwell on the earth.",
      "40:8": "And after that I asked the angel of peace who went with me and showed me everything that is hidden, “Who are these four figures that I have seen and whose words I have heard and written down?”",
      "40:9": "And he said to me, “The first one, <who> is merciful and long-suffering, (is) Michael. The second one, who (is) in charge of every sickness and every wound of the sons of men, is Raphael. The third one, who (is) in charge of every power, is Gabriel. The fourth one, who (is) in charge of the repentance to hope of those who inherit everlasting life, his name (is) Phanuel.”",
      "40:10": "These are the four angels of the Lord of Spirits; and the four voices I heard in those days.",
      "41:1": "And after this, I saw all the secrets of heaven, how the kingdom is divided, and how human deeds are weighed in the balance.",
      "41:2": "There I saw the dwelling places of the chosen and the dwelling places of the holy ones. And my eyes saw there all the sinners who deny the name of the Lord of Spirits being driven away from there, and they dragged them off and they could not remain because of the scourge that went forth from the Lord of Spirits.",
      "41:9": "For no angel hinders and no power is able to hinder,     for the Judge sees them all and judges them all in his presence.",
      "42:1": "Wisdom did not find a place where she might dwell, so her dwelling was in the heavens.",
      "42:2": "Wisdom went forth to dwell among the sons of men, but she did not find a dwelling. Wisdom returned to her place, and sat down in the midst of the angels.",
      "42:3": "Iniquity went forth from her chambers, those whom she did not seek she found, and she dwelt among them like rain in a desert and dew in a thirsty land.",
      "41:3": "And there my eyes saw the secrets of the lightnings and the thunder, and the secrets of the winds, how they are divided to blow upon the earth, and the secrets of the clouds and the dew. And there I saw whence they proceed in that place, and from there they saturate the dust of the earth.",
      "41:4": "There I saw closed storehouses, and from them the winds are distributed; the storehouse of the hail and the winds, the storehouse of the mist and of the clouds, and its cloud abides over the earth since the beginning of the age.",
      "41:5": "And I saw the storehouses of the sun and the moon, from which they emerge and to which they return, and their glorious return, and how the one is more praiseworthy than the other, and their splendid course. And they do not leave the course, and they neither extend nor diminish their course. And they keep faith with one another according to the oath that they have <sworn>.",
      "41:6": "And first the sun emerges and completes its path according to the command of the Lord of Spirits— and his name endures forever and ever.",
      "41:7": "And after that I saw the invisible and visible path of the moon, it completes the course of its path in that place by day and by night. And the one is opposite the other in the presence of the Lord of Spirits; and they give praise and glory and do not rest, for their praise is rest for them.",
      "41:8": "For the sun (makes) many revolutions for a blessing and a curse, and the course of the path of the moon is light to the righteous and darkness to the sinners, In the name of the Lord who distinguished between light and darkness, and divided the spirits of humanity, and strengthened the spirits of the righteous in the name of his righteousness.",
      "43:1": "And I saw other lightnings and stars of heaven; and I saw that he called them by their names, and they listened to him.",
      "43:2": "I saw a righteous balance, how they are weighed according to their light, according to the breadth of their spaces and the day of their appearing. (I saw how) their revolution produces lightning, and their revolution is according to the number of the angels, and they keep their faith with one another.",
      "43:3": "And I asked the angel who went with me and showed me what was hidden, “What are these?”",
      "43:4": "And he said to me, “The Lord of Spirits has shown you a parable concerning them; these are the names of the holy ones who dwell on the earth and believe in the name of the Lord of Spirits forever and ever.”",
      "44:1": "And another thing I saw regarding the lightning: how some stars arise and become lightning, and they cannot depart from their form.",
      "45:1": "This is the second parable concerning those who deny the name of the dwelling of the holy ones and of the Lord of Spirits.",
      "45:2": "To heaven they will not ascend, and on earth they will not come. Thus will be the lot of the sinners who have denied the name of the Lord of Spirits, who will be kept thus for the day of affliction and ­tribulation.",
      "45:3": "On that day, my Chosen One will sit on the throne of glory, and he will <test> their works, and their dwelling place(s) will be innumerable. And their souls will be distressed within them, when they see my chosen ones, and those who appeal to my glorious name.",
      "45:4": "On that day, I shall make my Chosen One dwell among them, and I shall transform heaven and make it a blessing and a light forever;",
      "45:5": "and I shall transform the earth and make it a blessing. And my chosen ones I shall make to dwell on it, but those who commit sin and error will not set foot on it.",
      "45:6": "For I have seen and satisfied my righteous ones with peace and have made them to dwell in my presence. But the judgment of the sinners has drawn near to me, that I may destroy them from the face of the earth.",
      "46:1": "There I saw one who had a head of days, and his head was like white wool. And with him was another, whose face was like the ­appearance of a man; and his face was full of graciousness like one of the holy angels.",
      "46:2": "And I asked the angel of peace, who went with me and showed me all the hidden things, about that son of man —who he was and whence he was (and) why he went with the Head of Days.",
      "46:3": "And he answered me and said to me, “This is the son of man who has righteousness, and righteousness dwells with him. and all the treasuries of what is hidden he will reveal; For the Lord of Spirits has chosen him, and his lot has prevailed through truth in the presence of the Lord of Spirits forever.",
      "46:4": "And this son of man whom you have seen— he will raise the kings and the mighty from their couches, and the strong from their thrones. He will loosen the reins of the strong, and he will crush the teeth of the sinners.",
      "46:5": "He will overturn the kings from their thrones and their kingdoms, because they do not exalt him or praise him, or humbly acknowledge whence the kingdom was given to them.",
      "46:6": "The face of the strong he will turn aside, and he will fill them with shame. Darkness will be their dwelling, and worms will be their couch. And they will have no hope to rise from their couches, because they do not exalt the name of the Lord of Spirits.",
      "46:7": "These are they who judge the stars of heaven, and raise their hands against the Most High, and tread upon the earth and dwell on it. All their deeds manifest unrighteousness, and their power (rests) upon their wealth. Their faith is in the gods they have made with their hands, and they deny the name of the Lord of Spirits.",
      "46:8": "And they persecute the houses of his congregation, and the faithful who depend on the name of the Lord of Spirits.”",
      "47:1": "In those days, there had arisen the prayer of the righteous, and the blood of the righteous one, from the earth into the presence of the Lord of Spirits.",

      "47:3": "In those days I saw the Head of Days as he took his seat on the throne of his glory, and the books of the living were opened in his presence, and all his host, which was in the heights of heaven, and his court, were standing in his presence.",
      "47:4": "And the hearts of the holy ones were filled with joy, for the number of <the righteous> was at hand; and the prayer of the righteous had been heard, and (a reckoning of) the blood of the righteous one had been required in the presence of the Lord of Spirits.",
      "48:1": "In that place I saw the spring of righteousness, and it was inexhaustible, and many springs of wisdom surrounded it; And all the thirsty drank from them and were filled with wisdom; and their dwelling places were with the righteous and the holy and the chosen.",
      "48:2": "And in that hour that son of man was named in the presence of the Lord of Spirits, and his name, before the Head of Days.",
      "48:3": "Even before the sun and the constellations were created, before the stars of heaven were made, his name was named before the Lord of Spirits.",
      "48:4": "He will be a staff for the righteous, that they may lean on him and not fall; He will be the light of the nations, and he will be a hope for those who grieve in their hearts.",
      "48:5": "All who dwell on the earth will fall down and worship before him, and they will glorify and bless and sing hymns to the name of the Lord of Spirits.",
      "48:6": "For this (reason) he was chosen and hidden in his presence, before the world was created and forever.",
      "48:7": "And the wisdom of the Lord of Spirits has revealed him to the holy and the righteous; for he has preserved the lot of the righteous. For they have hated and despised this age of unrighteousness; Indeed, all its deeds and its ways they have hated in the name of the Lord of Spirits. For in his name they are saved, and he is the vindicator of their lives.",
      "48:8": "In those days, downcast will be the faces of the kings of the earth, and the strong who possess the land, because of the deeds of their hands. For on the day of their tribulation and distress they will not save themselves;",
      "48:9": "and into the hand of my chosen ones I shall throw them. As straw in the fire and as lead in the water, thus they will burn before the face of the holy, and they will sink before the face of the righteous; and no trace of them will be found.",
      "48:10": "And on the day of their distress there will be rest on the earth, and before them they will fall and not rise, and there will be no one to take them with his hand and raise them. For they have denied the Lord of Spirits and his Anointed One. Blessed be the name of the Lord of Spirits.",
      "49:1": "For wisdom has been poured out like water, and glory will not fail in his presence forever and ever.",
      "49:2": "For he is mighty in all the secrets of righteousness; and unrighteousness will vanish like a shadow, and will have no place to stand. For the Chosen One has taken his stand in the presence of the Lord of Spirits; and his glory is forever and ever, and his might, to all generations.",
      "49:3": "And in him dwell the spirit of wisdom and the spirit of insight, and the spirit of instruction and might, and the spirit of those who have fallen asleep in ­righteousness.",
      "49:4": "And he will judge the things that are secret, and a lying word none will be able to speak in his ­presence; For he is the Chosen One in the presence of the Lord of Spirits according to his good pleasure.",
      "50:1": "In those days a change will occur for the holy and chosen, and the light of (many) days will dwell upon them, and glory and honor will return to the holy.",
      "50:2": "On the day of distress, evil will be stored up against the sinners, and the righteous will conquer in the name of the Lord of Spirits. And he will show (this) to the others, so that they repent and abandon the works of their hands.",
      "50:3": "And they will have honor in the presence of the Lord of Spirits, and in his name they will be saved; and the Lord of Spirits will have mercy on them, for great is his mercy.",
      "50:4": "But he is righteous in his judgment, and in the presence of his glory unrighteousness will not stand; at his judgment the unrepentant will perish in his presence,",

      "51:4": "In those days the mountains will leap like rams, and the hills will skip like lambs satisfied with milk; and the faces of all the angels in heaven will be radiant with joy, and the earth will rejoice, and the righteous will dwell on it, and the chosen will go[upon it.",
      "52:1": "After those days, in that place where I had seen all the visions of what is hidden—for I had been carried off in a whirlwind, and they had taken me to the West—",
      "52:2": "There my eyes saw all the hidden things of heaven that will take place: a mountain of iron, and a mountain of copper, and a mountain of silver, and a mountain of gold, and a mountain of soft metal, and a mountain of lead.",
      "52:3": "And I asked the angel who went with me, “What are these things that I have seen in secret?”",
      "52:4": "And he said to me, “All these things that you have seen will be for the authority of his Anointed One, so that he may be powerful and mighty on the earth.”",
      "52:5": "And that angel of peace answered and said to me, “Wait a little while, and all the hidden things that surround the Lord of Spirits will be revealed to you.",
      "52:6": "These mountains that your eyes saw—the mountain of iron, and the mountain of copper, and the mountain of silver, and the mountain of gold, and the mountain of soft metal, and the mountain of lead— All these will be before the Chosen One like wax before the fire, and like the water that comes down from above upon these mountains, and they will be weak before his feet.",
      "52:7": "And in those days none will save himself either by gold or silver, and none will be able to flee.",
      "52:8": "And there will not be iron for war, nor a garment for a breastplate; copper will be of no use, and tin will be reckoned as nothing, and lead will not be desired.",

      "53:5": "And he said to me, “They are preparing these for the kings and the mighty of this earth, that they may perish thereby.”",
      "53:6": "And after this, the Righteous and Chosen One will cause the house of his congregation to appear; from then on, they will not be hindered in the name of the Lord of Spirits.",

      "60:20": "The wind of the dew, its dwelling (is) at the ends of the heaven, and it is connected with the storehouses of the rain, and its course (is) in winter and in summer, and its clouds and the clouds of the mist are associated, and the one gives to the other.",
      "60:21": "And when the wind of the rain moves from its storehouse, the angels come and open the storehouse, and bring it out, and when it is scattered on all the dry land, it is joined with the water that is on the dry land; and whenever it is joined with the water on the dry land, . . . . .",
      "60:22": "For the waters are for those who dwell on the dry land, for (they are) nourishment for the dry land from the Most High who is in heaven; therefore there is a measure for the rain, and the angels are given charge of it.",
      "60:23": "All these things I saw toward the garden of the righteous. The Flood and the Final Judgment",
      "60:1": "In the year 500, in the seventh month, on the fourteenth of the month, in the life of <Noah>, in that parable I saw how a mighty quaking made the heaven of heavens quake, and the host of the Most High and the angels—thousands of thousands and ten thousand times ten thousand—were greatly disturbed.",
      "60:2": "And the Head of Days was sitting on the throne of his glory, and the holy and righteous angels were standing around him.",
      "60:3": "And great trembling took hold of me, and fear seized me, and my loins were crushed, and my kidneys were ­loosened, and I fell on my face.",
      "60:4": "And Michael sent another angel from among the holy ones, and he raised me up, and when he raised me up, my spirit returned. For I had not been able to endure the appearance of that host, and its turmoil and the quaking of the heavens.",
      "60:5": "And Michael said to me, “What have you seen, that you are so disturbed? Until today has the day of his mercy lasted, and he has been merciful and long suffering to those who dwell on the earth.",
      "60:6": "And when the day and the power and the punishment and the judgment come, which the Lord of Spirits has ­prepared for those who do not worship the righteous <judge>, and for those who deny the righteous judgment, and for those who take his name in vain . . . And that day has been prepared for the elect, a covenant, for the sinners, a visitation.”",
      "60:7": "And on that day two monsters were separated—the female monster whose name is Leviathan, to dwell in the depth of the sea, above the fountains of the waters.",
      "60:8": "But the name of the male is Behemoth, who occupies with his breast the trackless desert named Dundayn east of the garden where the chosen and righteous dwell, where my great-grandfather was taken up, the seventh from Adam, the first man whom the Lord of Spirits created.",
      "60:9": "And I asked another angel to show me the might of those monsters, how they were separated in one day and were thrown the one into the depth of the sea, and the other into the dry land of the desert.",
      "60:10": "And he said to me, “Here, son of man, you wish to know what is hidden.”",
      "60:24": "And the angel of peace who was with me said, “These two monsters, prepared according to the greatness of the Lord, will provide food for <the chosen and righteous>} . . . . . so that the punishment of the Lord of Spirits rests upon them, in order that the punishment of the Lord of Spirits does not go forth in vain. And the children will be killed with their mothers, and the children with their fathers.",
      "60:25": "When the punishment of the Lord of Spirits rests upon them, afterwards will be the judgment according to his mercy and his longsuffering.”",
      "61:1": "And I saw in those days, long cords were given to those angels, and they took for themselves wings and flew and went toward the North.",
      "61:2": "And I asked the angel, “Why did these take the cords and go?” And he said to me, “They went so that they may measure.”",
      "61:3": "And the angel who went with me said to me, “These will bring the measurements of the righteous, and the ropes of the righteous to the righteous; so that they may rely on the name of the Lord of Spirits forever and ever.",
      "61:4": "And the chosen will begin to dwell with the chosen; and these are the measurements that will be given to faith, and they will strengthen righteousness.",
      "61:5": "And these measurements will reveal all the secrets of the depths of the earth, and those who were destroyed by the desert, and those who were devoured by beasts, and those who were devoured by the fish of the sea; so that they may return and rely on the day of the Chosen One, for no one will be destroyed in the presence of the Lord of Spirits, and no one is able to be destroyed.” The Enthronement of the Chosen One",
      "61:6": "And all who are in the heights of heaven received a command, and power and one voice and one light like fire were given to him.",
      "61:7": "And that one, before anything, they blessed with (their) voice, and they exalted and glorified with wisdom; and they were wise in speech and in the spirit of life.",
      "61:8": "And the Lord of Spirits seated the Chosen One upon the throne of glory; and he will judge all the works of the holy ones in the heights of heaven, and in the balance he will weigh their deeds.",
      "61:9": "And when he will lift up his face to judge their secret ways according to the word of the name of the Lord of Spirits, and their paths according to the way of the righteous judgment of the Lord of Spirits, they will all speak with one voice, and bless and glorify and exalt and sanctify the name of the Lord of Spirits.",
      "61:10": "And all the host of the heavens will cry out and all the holy ones in the heights, and the host of the Lord—the Cherubin, the Seraphin, and the Ophannin, and all the angels of power and all the angels of the dominions, and the Chosen One and the other host who are on the dry land and over the water on that day.",
      "61:11": "And they will raise one voice, and they will bless and glorify and exalt with the spirit of faithfulness and with the spirit of wisdom, and with (a spirit of) long suffering and with the spirit of mercy, and with the spirit of judgment and peace and with the spirit of goodness. And they will all say with one voice, “Blessed (is he), and blessed be the name of the Lord of Spirits forever and ever.”",
      "61:12": "And all who sleep not in the heights of heaven will bless him, and all the holy ones who are in heaven will bless him, and all the chosen who dwell in the garden of life. And every spirit of light that is able to bless and glorify and exalt and sanctify your blessed name, and all flesh that in excess of (its) power glorifies and blesses your name forever and ever.",
      "61:13": "For great is the mercy of the Lord of Spirits, and he is slow to anger; and all his deeds and all his mighty acts, as many as he has done, he has revealed to the righteous and the chosen in the name of the Lord of Spirits.",
      "62:1": "And thus the Lord commanded the kings and the mighty and the exalted and those who possess the land, and he said, “Open your eyes and lift up your horns, if you are able to recognize the Chosen One.”",
      "62:2": "And the Lord of Spirits <seated him> upon the throne of his glory, and the spirit of righteousness was poured upon him. And the word of his mouth will slay all the sinners, and all the unrighteous will perish from his presence.",
      "62:3": "And there will stand up on that day all the kings and the mighty and the exalted and those who possess the land. And they will see and recognize that he sits on the throne of his glory; and righteousness is judged in his presence, and no lying word is spoken in his presence.",
      "62:4": "And pain will come upon them as (upon) a woman in labor, when the child enters the mouth of the womb, and she has difficulty in giving birth.",
      "62:5": "And one group of them will look at the other; and they will be terrified and will cast down their faces, and pain will seize them when they see that Son of Man sitting on the throne of his glory.",
      "62:6": "And the kings and the mighty and all who possess the land will bless and glorify and exalt him who rules over all, who was hidden.",
      "62:7": "For from the beginning the Son of Man was hidden, and the Most High preserved him in the presence of his might, and he revealed him to the chosen.",
      "62:8": "And the congregation of the chosen and holy will be sown; and all the chosen will stand in his presence on that day. The Condemnation of the Kings and the Mighty",
      "62:9": "And all the kings and the mighty and the exalted and those who rule the land will fall on their faces in his presence; and they will worship and set their hope on that Son of Man, and they will supplicate and petition for mercy from him.",
      "62:10": "But the Lord of Spirits himself will press them, so that they will hasten to depart from his presence; and their faces will be filled with shame, and the darkness will grow deeper on their faces.",
      "62:11": "And he will deliver them to the angels for punishment, so that they may exact retribution from them for the iniquity that they did to his children and his ­chosen ones.",
      "62:12": "And they will be a spectacle for the righteous and for his chosen ones; and they will rejoice over them, because the wrath of the Lord of Spirits rests upon them, and his sword is drunk with them.",
      "62:13": "And the righteous and the chosen will be saved on that day; and the faces of the sinners and the unrighteous they will henceforth not see.",
      "62:14": "And the Lord of Spirits will abide over them, and with that Son of Man they will eat, and they will lie down and rise up forever and ever.",
      "62:15": "And the righteous and chosen will have arisen from the earth, and have ceased to cast down their faces, and have put on the garment of glory.",
      "62:16": "And this will be your garment, the garment of life from the Lord of Spirits; and your garments will not wear out, and your glory will not fade in the presence of the Lord of Spirits.",
      "63:1": "In those days, the mighty and the kings who possess the land will implore the angels of his punishment, to whom they have been delivered, to give them a little respite that they might fall down and worship in the presence of the Lord of Spirits, and that they might confess their sins in his presence.",
      "63:2": "They will bless and glorify the Lord of Spirits and say, “Blessed is the Lord of Spirits and the Lord of kings, and the Lord of the mighty and the Lord of the rich, and the Lord of glory and the Lord of wisdom.",
      "63:3": "Your power is splendid in every secret thing for all generations, and your glory, forever and ever. Deep are all your secrets and without number, and your righteousness is beyond reckoning.",
      "63:4": "Now we know that we should glorify and bless the Lord of the kings, and him who reigns over all kings.”",
      "63:5": "And they will say, “Would that we might be given respite, that we might glorify and praise and make confession in the presence of your glory.",
      "63:6": "Now we desire a little respite and do not find it, we pursue it and do not lay hold of it. And light has vanished from our presence, and darkness is our dwelling forever and ever.",
      "63:7": "For in his presence we did not make confession, nor did we glorify the name of the Lord of the kings; Our hope was on the scepter of our kingdom and <throne of> our glory.",
      "63:8": "But on the day of our affliction and tribulation it does not save us, nor do we find respite to make confession, that our Lord is faithful in all his deeds and his judgment and his justice, and his judgments have no respect for persons.",
      "63:9": "And we vanish from his presence because of our deeds, and all our sins are reckoned in righteousness.”",
      "63:10": "Now they will say to themselves, “Our lives are full of ill-gotten wealth, but it does not prevent us from descending into the flame of the torment of Sheol.”",
      "63:11": "And after that their faces will be filled with darkness and shame in the presence of that Son of Man; and from his presence they will be driven, and a sword will abide before him in their midst.",
      "63:12": "Thus says the Lord of Spirits, “This is the law and the judgment of the mighty and the kings and the exalted and those who possess the land in the presence of the Lord of Spirits.”",
      "64:1": "And other figures I saw hidden in that place.",
      "64:2": "I heard the voice of the angel saying, “These are the angels who descended upon the earth. And what was hidden they revealed to human beings, and they led human beings astray so that they committed sin.”",
      "65:1": "In those days Noah saw that the earth had tilted and its destruction was near.",
      "65:2": "And he set out from there and went to the ends of the earth and cried to his great-grandfather, Enoch. And Noah said three times with a bitter voice, “Hear me, hear me, hear me.”",
      "65:4": "And after that there was great quaking upon the earth, and a voice was heard from heaven, and I fell on my face.",
      "65:5": "And Enoch my great-grandfather came and stood by me and said to me, “Why have you cried to me with bitter cry and lamentation?”",
      "65:3": "I said to him, “Tell me what is happening upon the earth, that the earth staggers so and shakes, lest I perish with it.”",
      "65:9": "And after this, my great-grandfather Enoch took me by my hand and raised me up and said to me, “Go, for I have asked the Lord of Spirits about the quaking upon the earth.",
      "65:6": "“A command has gone forth from the presence of the Lord against the inhabitants of the earth, that their end is accomplished, for they have learned all the secrets of the angels and all the violence of the satans, and all their powers, the hidden secrets and all the powers of those who practice sorcery, and the powers of (brightly) color(ed garments), and the powers of those who cast molten (images) for all the earth.",
      "65:7": "And how silver is produced from the dust of the earth and how soft metal <is poured out> on the earth.",
      "65:8": "For lead and tin are not produced from the earth like the former; there is a fountain that produces them, and an angel stands in it, and the angel is preeminent.”",
      "65:10": "And he said to me, “Because of their iniquity, their judgment has been accomplished and will not be withheld in my presence; because of the sorceries that they have searched out and learned, the earth will be destroyed, and those who dwell on it.",
      "65:11": "And these will never have a place of refuge forever, for they have shown them what is hidden, and they are judged. But as for you, my son, the Lord of Spirits knows that you are pure and blameless of this reproach concerning the mysteries.",
      "65:12": "And he has established your name among the holy ones, and he will preserve you from among those who dwell on the earth, And he has established your righteous seed (to be) kings and for great honors. And from your seed there will flow a fountain of the ­righteous and the holy, and they will be without number forever.”",
      "66:1": "And after this, he showed me the angels of punishment, who are ready to go forth and let loose all the power of the water that is beneath the earth, that it might be for the judgment and destruction of all who reside and dwell on the earth.",
      "66:2": "And the Lord of Spirits commanded the angels who were going forth, that they not raise their hands, but that they keep watch; for these angels were in charge of the power of the waters.",
      "66:3": "And I went forth from the presence of Enoch.",
      "67:1": "And in those days the word of God came to me and said to me, “Noah, your lot has come up to me, a lot without blame, a lot of love and uprightness.",
      "67:2": "And now the angels are making a wooden (vessel), and when the angels have completed that task, I will put my hand upon it and protect it. And from it will come the seed of life, and a change will take place, so that the earth will not remain desolate.",
      "67:3": "And I will establish your seed in my presence forever and ever, and I will scatter those who dwell with you, and I will not (again) bring temptation on the face of the earth, and they will be blessed and be multiplied on the earth, in the name of the Lord.”",
      "67:4": "And he will confine those angels who showed iniquity in that burning valley that my great-grandfather Enoch had shown me previously in the West by the mountains of gold and silver and iron and soft metal and tin.",
      "67:5": "And I saw that valley in which there was a great disturbance and troubling of the waters.",
      "67:6": "And when all this happened, from that fiery molten metal and the troubling of (the waters) in that place, the smell of sulfur was generated, and it mixed with those waters; and the valley of those angels who had led (humans) astray burned beneath that ground.",
      "67:7": "And through the valleys of that (area) rivers of fire issue, where those angels will be judged who led astray those who dwell on the earth.",
      "67:8": "And in those days those waters (will serve) the kings and the mighty and the exalted and those who dwell on the earth, for the healing of (their) flesh and the judgment of their spirits. And their spirits are full of pleasure, so that their flesh will be judged, because they denied the Lord of Spirits. And they see their judgment every day and do not believe in his name.",
      "67:9": "And the more their flesh is burnt, the more a change takes place in their spirits, forever and ever, because before the Lord of Spirits no one speaks a lying word.",
      "67:10": "For judgment will come upon them because they believe in the pleasure of their flesh, but they deny the Lord of Spirits.",
      "67:11": "And those same waters will be changed in those days, for when those angels are judged in those waters, those springs of water will change their temperature, and when the angels come up, the waters of those springs will be changed and become cold.",
      "67:12": "And I heard Michael answer and say, “This judgment with which the angels are judged is a testimony for the kings and the mighty who possess the land.",
      "67:13": "For these waters of judgment (serve) for the healing of the flesh of the kings, and for the pleasure of their flesh, and they do not see and do not believe that those waters will be changed and become a fire that burns forever.”",
      "68:1": "And after this, my great-grandfather gave me the explanation of all the secrets in a book, and the parables that were given to him, and gathered them for me in the words of the Book of Parables.",
      "68:2": "And on that day, Michael answered and said to Raphael, “The power of the spirit seizes me and aggravates me, because of the harshness of the judgment of the secrets, the judgment of the angels; for who can endure the harshness of the judgment that has been executed before which they melt?”",
      "68:3": "And again Michael answered and said to Raphael, “Who is there who would not soften his heart over it, and whose kidneys would not be troubled by this word? Judgment has gone forth against them, who have led them out thus.”",
      "68:4": "But when they stood before the Lord of Spirits, Michael spoke thus to Raphael, “I will not take their part under the eye of the Lord, because the Lord of Spirits is angry with them, because they act as if they were like the Lord.  Therefore, everything that is hidden will come upon them forever and ever; for no angel or human will receive their lot, but they alone have received their judgment forever and ever.",
      "69:1": "And after this judgment, they will trouble them and aggravate them, because they have shown this to those who dwell on the earth.”",
      "69:2": "Look, the names of those angels, {and these are their names: their first is Shemihazah; and the second is Arteqoph; the third is <Remashel>; the fourth is Kokabel; the fifth is Turel; the sixth is Ramel; the seventh is Daniel; the eighth is Ziqel; the ninth is Baraqel; the tenth is Asael; the eleventh is Hermani; the twelfth is Matarel; the thirteenth is Basasel; the fourteenth is Ananel; the fifteenth is Turel; the sixteenth is Shamsiel; the seventeenth is <Sah\\riel> ; the eighteenth is <Tummiel>; the nineteenth is <Turiel>; the ­twentieth is <Yamiel>; the twenty-first is Azazel.",

      "69:4": "And the name of the first is Yeqon, this is the one who led all the children of the angels astray and brought them down upon the earth, and led them astray through the daughters of men.",
      "69:5": "And the name of the second is Asbe’el. This one gave evil counsel to the children of the holy angels, and led them astray so that they ruined their bodies through the daughters of men.",
      "69:6": "And the name of the third is Gadre’el. This is the one who showed all the blows of death to the sons of men, and he led Eve astray, and he showed the shield and the coat of mail and the sword for battle and all the implements of death to the sons of men.",
      "69:7": "And from his hand they have gone forth against those who dwell on the earth from that day and forever and ever.",
      "69:8": "And the name of the fourth is Penemue. This one showed the sons of men the bitter and the sweet and showed them all the secrets of their wisdom.  9 He gave humans knowledge about writing with ink and papyrus, and therefore many went astray from of old and forever and until this day.",
      "69:10": "For humans were not born for this purpose, to confirm their trustworthiness through pen and ink.",
      "69:11": "For humans were not created to be different from the angels, so that they should remain pure and righteous. And death, which ruins everything, would not have laid its hand on them. But through this, their knowledge, they are perishing, and through this power it devours us.",
      "69:12": "And the name of the fifth is Kasdeya. This is the one who showed the sons of men all the evil blows of spirits and demons, and the blows of the foetus in the womb, so that it aborts, and {the blow of the soul,} the bite of the serpent, and the blow that comes in the noonday heat, the son of the serpent, whose name (is) Taba>et.",

      "69:19": "And through that oath the <pillars of the> deep were made firm, and they have stood and are not shaken from their place from of old and forever.",
      "69:20": "And through that oath the sun and the moon complete their course, and they do not transgress their commands from of old <and forever>.",

      "70:4": "And there I saw the first fathers and the righteous, who were dwelling in that place from of old. Enoch Ascends to Heaven and Sees the Heavenly Secrets",
      "71:1": "And after that, my spirit was taken away, and it ascended to heaven. And I saw the sons of the holy angels, and they were stepping on flames of fire; and their garments were white, as were their tunics, and the light of their faces was like snow.",
      "71:2": "And I saw two rivers of fire, and the light of that fire shone like hyacinth, and I fell on my face before the Lord of Spirits.",
      "71:3": "And the angel Michael, one of the archangels, took me by my right hand and raised me up, and he brought me out to all the secrets; and he showed me all the secrets of mercy, and he showed me all the secrets of righteousness.",
      "71:4": "And he showed me all the secrets of the ends of heaven and all the treasuries of the stars, and all the luminaries go forth from there before the holy ones. Enoch Ascends to the Heavenly Palace",
      "71:5": "And he took my spirit—even me, Enoch—to the heaven of heavens, and I saw there, as it were, <a house> built of hailstones, and between those stones were tongues of living fire.",
      "71:6": "And my spirit saw <in that light> a circle that encircled that house of fire, from the four sides of that <house> (came) rivers full of living fire, and they encircled that house.",
      "71:7": "And around it (were) Seraphin and Cherubin, and Ophannin, and those who sleep not, but guard the throne of his glory.",
      "71:8": "And I saw angels that could not be counted, thousands of thousands and ten thousand times ten ­thousand; they were surrounding that house. And Michael and Raphael and Gabriel and Phanuel, and the holy angels who (are in) the heights of heaven, were going in and out in that house. Enoch Sees the Angels and the Head of Days",
      "71:9": "And there came out of that house Michael and Raphael and Gabriel and Phanuel and many holy angels without number.",

      "71:15": "And he said to me, “He proclaims peace to you in the name of the age that is to be, for from there peace has proceeded from the creation of the age, and thus you will have it forever and forever and ever.",
      "71:16": "And all will walk on your path since righteousness will never forsake you; with you will be their dwelling and with you, their lot, and from you they will not be separated forever and ­forever and ever.",
      "71:17": "And thus there will be length of days with that Son of Man, and there will be peace for the righteous, and the path of truth for the righteous, in the name of the Lord of Spirits forever and ever.”",
      "72:1": "The book about the motion of the heavenly luminaries all as they are in their kinds, their jurisdiction, their time, their name, their origins, and their months which Uriel, the holy angel who was with me (and) who is their leader, showed me. The entire book about them, as it is, he showed me and how every year of the world will be forever, until a new creation lasting forever is made.",
      "72:2": "This is the first law of the luminaries: the luminary (called) the sun has its emergence through the heavenly gates in the east and its setting through the western gates of the sky.  3 I saw six gates through which the sun emerges and six gates through which the sun sets. The moon rises and sets in those gates and the leaders of the stars with the ones they lead, six in the east and six in the west, all of them—one directly after the other. There are many windows on the right and left of those gates.",
      "72:4": "The first one to emerge is the great luminary whose name is the sun; its roundness is like the roundness of the sky. It is entirely filled with fire, which gives light and heat.",
      "72:5": "The wind blows the chariot where it rises, and the sun sets from the sky and goes back through the north in order to reach the east. It is guided so that it enters that gate and gives light in the firmament.",
      "72:6": "This is how it emerges in the first month through the large gate; it emerges through that fourth one of those six gates on the side where the sun rises.  7 In that fourth gate from which the sun emerges in the first month there are twelve open windows from which heat comes out when they are open at their times.",
      "72:8": "When the sun rises in the sky it emerges through that fourth gate for thirty mornings, and it accurately goes down in the fourth gate on the west side of the sky.",
      "72:9": "During those days, day becomes longer than day and night becomes shorter than night for thirty days.",
      "72:10": "On that day the daytime is two units more than the night—one-ninth, with the daytime being exactly ten parts, and the night exactly eight parts.",
      "72:11": "The sun emerges from that fourth gate and sets through the fourth (gate). It returns to the fifth gate in the east for thirty mornings, and it emerges from it and sets through the fifth gate.",
      "72:12": "Then the daytime becomes longer by two (additional) parts: the daytime is eleven parts, while the night decreases and is seven parts.",
      "72:13": "It returns to the east and enters the sixth (gate). It emerges and sets through the sixth gate for thirty-one days because of its sign.",
      "72:14": "During that day the daytime grows longer than the night, with the daytime being double the night. The daytime is twelve parts, while the night grows shorter and is six parts.",
      "72:15": "The sun rises so that the daytime becomes shorter and the night longer; the sun returns to the east and enters the sixth gate. It rises from it and sets for thirty days.",
      "72:16": "When the thirty days are completed, daytime decreases one part exactly; the daytime is eleven parts and the night seven.",
      "72:17": "The sun emerges from the west from that sixth gate, goes to the east, and rises in the fifth gate for thirty mornings. It again sets in the west, in the fifth western gate.  18 On that day the daytime is two parts fewer, with the daytime being ten parts and the night eight parts.",
      "72:19": "The sun emerges from that fifth gate and sets through the fifth gate in the west; it rises through the fourth gate because of its sign—in the fourth gate in the east—thirty-one mornings and sets in the west.",
      "72:20": "On that day the daytime is equal to the night; it is the same: the night is nine parts and the daytime nine parts as well.  21 The sun emerges from that gate and sets in the west; it returns to the east and emerges through the third gate for thirty mornings and sets in the west through the third gate.",
      "72:22": "On that day the night is longer than the daytime; night becomes longer than night, day becomes shorter than day for thirty days. The night is ten parts exactly and the daytime eight parts.",
      "72:23": "The sun emerges from that third gate and sets through the third gate in the west; it returns to the east and emerges through the second gate in the east for thirty mornings; in the same way it sets through the second gate on the west side of the sky.  24 On that day the night is eleven parts and the daytime seven parts.",
      "72:25": "The sun emerges on that day from that second gate and sets in the west through the second gate. It returns to the east in the first gate for thirty-one mornings and sets through the first gate in the west.  26 On that day the night is longer and is double the daytime; the night is twelve parts exactly and the daytime six parts.",
      "72:27": "The sun has completed the chief points of its (route). It again goes about on those chief points of its (route) and enters each gate for thirty mornings, and it sets in the west opposite it.",
      "72:28": "On that day the night decreases in length by a ninth part, that is, one part and is a night of eleven parts and a daytime of seven parts.",
      "72:29": "The sun returned and entered the second gate on the east. It returns upon those chief points of its (route); for thirty days it rises and sets.  30 On that day the night decreases in length (relative to the daytime), with the night being ten parts and the daytime eight parts.",
      "72:31": "On that day the sun emerges from that gate and sets in the west; it returns to the east and rises through the third gate for thirty-one mornings and sets on the west side of the sky.",
      "72:32": "On that day the night decreases and is nine parts, with a daytime of nine parts. Daytime is equal to the night, and the year is exactly 364 days.",
      "72:33": "The length of the daytime and the night and the shortness of the daytime and the night vary during the course of the sun.",
      "72:34": "For this reason its course grows longer day by day and night by night it grows shorter.",
      "72:35": "This is the law and course of the sun: its return when it returns sixty times and emerges. It is the great luminary which is called the sun forever.",
      "72:36": "This one that emerges is the great luminary, and it is named after its appearance as the Lord commanded.",
      "72:37": "In this way it emerges and so it enters; it neither decreases nor rests but runs day and night. Its light is seven times brighter than that of the moon, but the size of the two is equal.",
      "73:1": "After this law I saw a second law for the smaller luminary whose name is the moon.",
      "73:2": "Its roundness is like the roundness of the sky, and the wind blows its chariot on which it rides, with light being given to it in measure.",
      "73:3": "Each month its emergence and setting change, and its days are like the days of the sun. When its light is evenly distributed (over its surface), it is one-seventh the light of the sun.",
      "73:4": "In this way it rises with its beginning toward the east; it emerges on the thirtieth day, and on that day it is visible. It becomes for you the beginning of the month on the thirtieth day with the sun in the gate where the sun emerges.",
      "73:5": "Its half is distant one-seventh part (from the sun?), and all its disc is empty, with no light except its seventh part, one-fourteenth part of its light.",
      "73:6": "During the day it takes on a seventh part of half its light (i.e., one-fourteenth) and its illuminated section is a half seventh part.",
      "73:7": "It sets with the sun, and when the sun rises it rises with it and receives a half part of light. During that night, at the beginning of its day, at the beginning of the moon’s day, the moon sets with the sun and is dark that night six seventh parts and a half.  8 It rises during that day (with) a seventh part exactly. It emerges and recedes from the rising of the sun and is bright in the rest of its day six seventh parts.",
      "74:1": "Another course and law I saw for it; by that law it carries out its monthly course.",
      "74:2": "All this Uriel the holy angel who is the leader of them all showed me. Their positions I wrote down as he showed me and I wrote down their months as they were and the appearance of their light until fifteen days were completed.  3 In one-seventh parts it completes all its light in the east and in the west.",
      "74:4": "In certain months it changes (the places of) its settings, and in certain months it goes its own way.  5 During two months it sets with the sun in those two middle gates—in the third and in the fourth gate.",
      "74:6": "It emerges for seven days, goes around, and returns again to the gate from which the sun emerges; it completes all its light, recedes from the sun, and enters for eight days into the sixth gate from which the sun emerges.",
      "74:7": "When the sun emerges from the fourth gate, (the moon) emerges for seven days until it emerges from the fifth; it again returns in seven days into the fourth gate and completes all its light. It recedes and enters into the first gate for eight days.",
      "74:8": "It again returns in seven days into the fourth gate from which the sun emerges.",
      "74:9": "In this way I saw their positions, as the moon rises and the sun sets during those days.",
      "74:10": "When five years are added up, the total comes to thirty (extra) days for the sun. All the days that result for one of those five years, when complete, are 364 days.",
      "74:11": "The extra amount for the sun and stars comes to six days; for five years six (extra) days come to thirty days, and the moon is thirty days less than the sun and the stars,",
      "74:12": "and they bring about the year precisely, all according to their eternal positions. They come neither early nor late by one day by which they would change the year: each is exactly 364 days.",
      "74:13": "In three years there are 1,092 days; in five years there are 1,820 days, with the result that in eight years there are 2,912.",
      "74:14": "For the moon alone, the days in three years come to 1,062; in five years it is fifty days fewer.",
      "74:15": "In five years there are 1,770 days with the result that in eight years the moon has 2,832 days.",
      "74:16": "For in eight years eighty days are lacking; all the days that it lacks after eight years are eighty days.",
      "74:17": "Then the year is correctly completed in accord with their eternal positions and the positions of the sun; they rise from the gate from which it rises and sets for 30 days.",
      "75:1": "The leaders of the heads of the thousands who are over all the creation and over all the stars (have to do) with those four (days) that are added; they are not separated from their position according to the calculation of the year, and they serve on the four days that are not reckoned in the calculation of the year.",
      "75:2": "People err regarding them because those lights truly serve (in) the position of the world: one in the first gate, one in the third heavenly gate, one in the fourth gate, and one in the sixth gate, and the accuracy of the world is completed in the 364 positions of the world.",
      "75:3": "For Uriel the angel whom the Lord of eternal glory set over all the heavenly luminaries, in the sky and in the world, showed me the sign, the seasons, the year and the days so that they may rule the firmament, appear above the earth, and be leaders of days and nights—the sun, the moon, the stars, and all the serving entities that go around in all the heavenly chariots.",
      "75:4": "In the same way Uriel showed me twelve gates open in the disc of the sun’s chariot in the sky from which the rays of the sun come out and from which its heat comes out upon the earth when they are opened at the times stipulated for them.",
      "75:5": "The entire v. 5 appears to be the result of textual errors and for this reason has been omitted from the translation.",
      "75:6": "The same is the case when the twelve gates are opened[ in the sky on the boundaries of the earth, from which the sun, the moon, the stars, and all the works of the sky emerge, on the east and on the west.",
      "75:7": "There are many windows opened on the left and right. Each window at its time emits heat like those gates from which the stars emerge as he ordered them and in which they set according to their number.",
      "75:8": "I saw chariots in the sky traveling in the world above those gates in which the stars that do not set revolve.",
      "75:9": "One is larger than all of them and it is the one that encircles the whole world.",
      "76:1": "At the boundaries of the earth I saw twelve gates open for all the winds, from which the winds emerge and blow on the earth.",
      "76:2": "Three of them are open in front of the sky, three on the west, three on the right of the sky, and three on the left.",
      "76:3": "The first three are toward the east, three toward the north; the three after these on the left are toward the south and three on the west.",
      "76:4": "Through four of them emerge winds of blessing and peace, but, from those (other) eight, winds of punishment emerge; when they are sent they bring devastation to the entire earth and the water on it, all that live on it, and all that are in the water and on the land.",
      "76:5": "The first wind, whose name is “eastern,” emerges from those gates through the first gate which is on the east and inclines toward the south; from it there emerge devastation, drought, heat, and destruction.",
      "76:6": "Through the second gate, the middle one, there emerge in a direct way rain, fruitfulness, prosperity, and dew; through the third gate which is to the north emerge cold and drought.",
      "76:7": "Following these the winds toward the south emerge through three gates. First, through the first gate that inclines toward the east a hot wind emerges.",
      "76:8": "Through the ­middle gate next to it there emerge a fragrant aroma, dew, rain, prosperity, and life.",
      "76:9": "Through the third gate that is toward the west there emerge dew, rain, locusts, and destruction.",
      "76:10": "Following these the winds that are toward the north, whose name is “sea,” and which emerge from the seventh gate that is toward the southeast—there emerge from it dew, rain, locust, destruction.",
      "76:11": "From the middle gate in a direct way there emerge life, rain, dew; through the third gate that is toward the west, inclining to the north, there emerge mist, hail, snow, rain, dew, and locust.",
      "76:12": "Following these (there are) four winds which are toward the west: (as for) the first gate toward the north, from it emerge dew, hail, cold, snow, frost.",
      "76:13": "From the middle gate there emerge dew, rain, prosperity, and blessing. From the last gate that is toward the south emerge drought, destruction, burning, and devastation.",
      "76:14": "The twelve gates of the four quarters of the sky are completed. All their laws and all their punishment and their prosperity—I have shown to you everything, my son Methuselah.",
      "77:1": "The first quarter is called “eastern” because it is the first; and the second is called “south” because there the Most High will descend and especially there the one who is blessed forever will descend.",
      "77:2": "The name of the quarter on the west is “diminished” because there all the heavenly luminaries diminish and go down.",
      "77:3": "The fourth quarter whose name is “north” is divided into three parts. One of them is the place where people live; the second is for the seas, the deeps, forests, rivers, darkness, and mist; and the other part is for the garden of righteousness.",
      "77:4": "I saw seven lofty mountains which are higher than all the mountains on the earth; from them snow emerges, and days, seasons, and years pass by.",
      "77:5": "I saw seven rivers on the earth, larger than all the rivers. One of them comes from the west (and) pours its water into the great sea.",
      "77:6": "Two of them come from the north to the sea and pour their water into the Erythrean Sea on the east.",
      "77:7": "The remaining four emerge on the northern side toward their sea, <two> into the Erythrean Sea and two into the great sea where they empty themselves, but some say into the wilderness.  8 I saw seven large islands in the sea and on the land—five on the land and two in the Erythrean Sea.",
      "78:1": "The names of the sun are as follows: the first Aryares and the second Tomas.",
      "78:2": "The moon has four names: its first name is Asanya, the second Abla, the third Banase, and the fourth Era.",
      "78:3": "These are the two great luminaries. Their roundness is like the roundness of the sky, and the size of the two of them is the same.",
      "78:4": "In the disc of the sun there are seven parts of light added to it beyond what the moon has; a specific amount is placed (in the moon) until the seventh part of the sun passes over.  5 They set and enter the gates of the west and go around the north and emerge through the gates of the east on the firmament.",
      "78:6": "When the moon rises, it is visible in the sky (with) one-half of a seventh part of all its light; on the fourteenth it completes its light.",
      "78:7": "Fifteen parts of light are placed in it until its light is completed in fifteen (days) for the sign of the year. It is in fifteen parts, while the moon grows by (units of) one-half of a seventh part.",
      "78:8": "When it is waning, on the first day it decreases to fourteen parts of its light, and on the next day it decreases to thirteen parts of light. On the third it decreases to twelve, on the fourth to eleven parts, on the fifth it decreases to ten parts, on the sixth it decreases to nine parts, on the seventh it decreases to eight parts, on the eighth it decreases to seven, on the ninth it decreases to six, on the tenth it decreases to five, on the eleventh it decreases to four, on the twelfth it decreases to three, on the thirteenth it decreases to two, on the fourteenth it decreases to one-half of a seventh part of all its light, and on the fifteenth day the entire remainder is exhausted.",
      "78:9": "During certain months the moon has 29 days and sometimes 28.",
      "78:10": "Uriel showed me another law: (regarding) when the light is placed in the moon and from where it is placed (in the moon) from the sun.  11 The entire time the moon progresses it adds its light when facing the sun until in fourteen days its light is complete. When it is all aflame its light is complete in the sky.  12 On the first day it is called the new moon because on that day the light rises on it.",
      "78:13": "It is complete precisely on the day the sun sets in the west and it rises from the east during the night and the moon shines during the entire night, until the sun rises opposite it and the moon is seen opposite the sun.",

      "80:2": "In the days of the sinners the rainy seasons will grow shorter, their seed will become late on their land and in their fields. Everything on the earth will change and will not appear at their times, the rain will be withheld, and the sky will stand still.",

      "80:7": "The entire law of the stars will be closed to the sinners, and the thoughts of those on the earth will err regarding them. They will turn back from all their ways, will err, and will take them to be gods.",
      "80:8": "Evil will multiply against them and punishment will come upon them to destroy all.”",
      "81:1": "He said to me: “Enoch, look at these heavenly tablets, read what is written on them, and understand each and every item.”",
      "81:2": "I looked at everything on the heavenly tablets, read everything that was written, and understood everything. I read the book, all the actions of people and of all humans who will be on the earth for the generations of the world.",
      "81:3": "From that time forward I blessed the great Lord, the king of glory forever, as he had made every work of the world. I praised the Lord because of his patience; I blessed (him) on account of humanity.  4 Afterwards I said: “Blessed is the one who dies righteous and good; regarding him no book of wickedness has been written and no day of judgment will be found.”",
      "81:5": "Those seven holy ones brought me and set me on the earth in front of the gate to my house. They said to me: “Tell everything to your son Methuselah and show all your children that no human is righteous before the Lord, for he created them.",

      "3:3": "I was lying down in the house of Mahalalel, my grandfather, (when) I saw in a vision. Heaven was thrown down and taken away, and it fell down upon the earth.",
      "3:4": "And when it fell upon the earth, I saw how the earth was swallowed up in the great abyss. Mountains were suspended upon mountains, and hills sank down upon hills; Tall trees were cut from their roots, and were thrown away and sank into the abyss.",
      "3:5": "And then speech fell into my mouth, and I lifted up (my voice) to cry out and said, “The earth has been destroyed.”",
      "3:6": "And Mahalalel my grandfather aroused me, since I was lying near him, and said to me, “Why do you cry out so, my son, and why do you lament so?”",
      "3:7": "And I recounted to him the whole vision that I had seen, and he said to me, “A terrible thing you have seen, my son, and mighty is the vision of your dream (in) the secrets of all the sin of the earth. It must sink into the abyss, and it will be utterly destroyed.",

      "85:4": "And that black calf struck the red one and pursued it over the earth. And from then on I could not see that red calf.",
      "85:5": "But that black calf grew up, and a young heifer came to it. And I saw that many cattle came forth from it, that were like it and were following after it.",

      "85:9": "And I saw in my sleep that white bull, that it grew likewise and became a large white bull, and from it came forth many white cattle, and they were like it.",
      "85:10": "And they began to bear many white cattle, which were like them, and each one followed the other.",
      "86:1": "And again I saw with my eyes as I was sleeping. I saw the heaven above, and look, a star fell from heaven, and it arose and was eating and pasturing among those cattle.",
      "86:2": "Then I saw those large and black cattle, and look, all of them exchanged their pens and their pastures and their calves, and they began to moan, one after the other.",
      "86:3": "And again I saw in the vision, and I looked to heaven, and look, I saw many stars descend and cast themselves down from heaven to that first star. And in the midst of those calves they became bulls, and they were pasturing with them in their midst.",
      "86:4": "I looked at them and I saw and look, all of them let out their organs like horses, and they began to mount the cows of the bulls, and they all conceived and bore elephants and camels and asses.",
      "86:5": "And all the bulls feared them and were terrified before them, and they began to bite with their teeth and devour and gore with their horns.",
      "86:6": "And they began to devour those bulls, and look, all the sons of the earth began to tremble and quake before them, and to flee. Divine Judgment",
      "87:1": "And again I saw them, and they began to gore one another and devour one another, and the earth began to cry out.",
      "87:2": "And I lifted my eyes again to heaven, and I saw in the vision, and look, there came forth from heaven (beings) with the appearance of white men; four came forth from that place and three with them.",
      "87:3": "And those three who came after took hold of me by my hand and raised me from the generations of the earth, and lifted me onto a high place, and they showed me a tower high above the earth, and all the hills were smaller.",
      "87:4": "And they said to me, ‘Stay here until you see all that happens to those elephants and camels and asses and to the stars and to the cattle and all of them.’",
      "88:1": "And I saw one of those four who had come before; he seized that first star that had fallen from heaven, and he bound it by its hands and feet and threw it into an abyss, and that abyss was narrow and deep and desolate and dark.",
      "88:2": "And one of these drew a sword and gave it to those elephants and camels and asses. And they began to strike one another, and the whole earth quaked because of them.",
      "88:3": "And as I looked in the vision, look, one of those four who had come forth hurled stones from heaven and gathered and took all the great stars, whose organs were like the organs of horses, and bound all of them by their hands and their feet, and threw them into an abyss of the earth.",
      "89:1": "And one of those four went to <one of the white bulls> and taught it a mystery—trembling as it was. It was born a bull but became a man. And he built himself a vessel and dwelt in it, and three bulls dwelt with him on that vessel, and the vessel was covered and roofed over them.",
      "89:2": "And again I lifted my eyes toward heaven, and I saw a high roof and seven sluices on it, and those sluices were pouring out much water into an enclosure.",
      "89:3": "And I looked again and look, fissures opened up in the floor in that large enclosure, and that water began to bubble up and rise above the floor, and I was looking at that enclosure until all the floor was covered with water.",

      "89:5": "And all the cattle of that enclosure were gathered together until I saw them sinking and being engulfed and perishing in that water.",
      "89:6": "And that vessel was floating on the waters, but all the bulls and elephants and camels and asses sank to the bottom together with every animal, so that I could not see them. And they were unable to escape but perished and sank in the deep.",
      "89:7": "And again I saw in the vision until those water channels were removed from that high roof and the fountains of the floor were stopped up, and other abysses were opened.",
      "89:8": "And the water began to descend into them until the floor was uncovered and that vessel settled onto the floor, and darkness withdrew and it became light. From the Disembarkation to the Exodus",
      "89:9": "That white bull who had become a man came out of that vessel, and the three bulls with him. And one of those three bulls was white like that bull, and one of them was red like blood, and one of them was black. And that white bull departed from them.",
      "89:10": "And they began to beget wild beasts and birds, so that there arose from them every kind of species: lions, leopards, wolves, dogs, hyenas, wild boars, foxes, conies, pigs, falcons, vultures, kites, eagles, and ravens. But among them a white bull was born.",
      "89:11": "And they began to bite one another, but that white bull that was born among them begot a wild ass and a white bull with it, and the wild asses increased.",
      "89:12": "But that bull that was born from it begot a black wild boar and a white ram of the flock. And that (wild boar) begot many boars, and that ram begat twelve sheep.",
      "89:13": "When those twelve sheep had grown up, they handed over one of themselves to the wild asses, and those wild asses, in turn, handed that sheep over to the wolves, and that sheep grew up among the wolves.",
      "89:14": "And the ram led forth the eleven sheep to dwell with it and to pasture with it among the wolves. And they multiplied and became many flocks of sheep.",
      "89:15": "And the wolves began to fear them and oppress them until they did away with their young, and they cast their young into a river of much water. And those sheep began to cry out because of their young and to make complaint to their Lord.",
      "89:16": "And a sheep that had escaped safely from the wolves fled and went off to the wild asses. And I saw the sheep groaning and crying out and petitioning their Lord with all their might, until that Lord of the sheep descended from a lofty chamber at the voice of the sheep, and he came to them and saw them.",
      "89:17": "And he summoned that sheep that had fled from the wolves, and he spoke to it about the wolves, that it should testify against them not to touch the sheep.  18 And the sheep went to the wolves at the command of the Lord, and another sheep met that sheep and went with it. And the two of them went and entered together into the assembly of those wolves. And they spoke to them and testified against them that they should not henceforth touch the sheep.",
      "89:19": "After this I saw the wolves, how they dealt more harshly with the sheep with all their might, and (how) the sheep cried out.",
      "89:20": "And their Lord came to the sheep and began to strike the wolves, and the wolves began to lament. But the sheep were quiet, and thereafter they did not cry out.",
      "89:21": "And I looked at the sheep until they went out from the wolves, and the wolves’ eyes were blinded, and the wolves went out pursuing those sheep with all their might.  22 And the Lord of the sheep went with them, leading them, and all his sheep followed him. And his face was dazzling and glorious and fearful to look at.",
      "89:23": "And the wolves began to pursue those sheep until they met them by a swamp of water.",
      "89:24": "And that swamp of water was split apart, and the water stood to one side and the other before them. And their Lord, as he led them, stood between them and the wolves.  25 And as those wolves still did not see the sheep, they went into the midst of that swamp of water. The wolves pursued the sheep, and those wolves ran after them into that swamp of water.",
      "89:26": "And when they saw the Lord of the sheep, they turned to flee from his presence, but that swamp of water flowed together and suddenly returned to its natural state. And the water swelled up and rose until it covered those wolves.  27 And I saw until all the wolves that had pursued those sheep perished and sank.",
      "89:28": "But the sheep departed from that water and went out to a desert, where there was no water or grass, and they began to open their eyes and see. And I saw <until> the Lord of the sheep was pasturing them and giving them water and grass, and that sheep was going and leading them.  29 That sheep went up to the summit of a high rock, and the Lord of the sheep sent it to them.  30 And after that, I saw the Lord of the sheep who stood before them, and his appearance was majestic and fearful and mighty, and all those sheep saw him and were afraid before him.  31 And all of them were afraid and trembling because of him, and they were crying out after that sheep with the other sheep that was in their midst, ‘We cannot stand before our Lord or look at him.’",
      "89:32": "And again that sheep that led them went up to the summit of that rock, and the sheep began to be blinded and to stray from the path that it had shown them, but the sheep did not know about these things.",
      "89:33": "And the Lord of the sheep was filled with great wrath against them, and that sheep discovered it and went down from the summit of that rock and came to the sheep and found most of them blinded and straying.",
      "89:34": "And when they saw it, they were afraid and trembled before it, and wished to return to their folds.",
      "89:35": "And that sheep took other sheep with it and went against those sheep that had strayed and began to slaughter them, and the sheep were afraid of it. And that sheep returned all the straying flock to their folds.",
      "89:36": "And I saw in this vision, until that sheep became a man and built a house for the Lord of the sheep and made all the sheep stand in that house.",
      "89:37": "And I saw until that sheep that had met that sheep that had led them fell asleep. And I saw until all the large sheep perished, and little ones arose in their place, and they came to a pasture and approached a river of water.",
      "89:38": "And that sheep that had led them, that had become a man, was separated from them and fell asleep, and all the sheep searched for him and cried bitterly because of him.",
      "89:39": "And I saw until they ceased crying for that sheep and crossed that stream of water, and <two> sheep arose that led them instead of those that had fallen asleep; and they led them.",
      "89:40": "And I saw the sheep until they were entering a good place and a pleasant and glorious land. And I saw those sheep until they were satisfied, and that house was in their midst in the pleasant land.",
      "89:41": "And sometimes their eyes were opened, and sometimes they were blinded, until another sheep arose and led them and brought them all back, and their eyes were opened.",
      "89:42": "And the dogs began to devour the sheep, and the wild boars and the foxes were devouring them, until the Lord of the sheep raised up a ram from among the sheep, which led them.",
      "89:43": "And this ram began to butt and pursue with its horns. And it hurled itself against the foxes and, after them, against the wild boars; and it destroyed many wild boars. And after them it <struck> the dogs.",
      "89:44": "And the sheep whose eyes were open saw the ram among the sheep until it forsook its path and began to walk where there was no path.",
      "89:45": "And the Lord of the sheep sent this sheep to another sheep to appoint it to be ram, to rule the sheep instead of the ram that had forsaken its way.",
      "89:46": "And it went to it and spoke with it secretly, alone, and appointed it to be ram and ruler and leader of the sheep. And during all these things, the dogs were oppressing the sheep.",
      "89:47": "And the first ram pursued the second ram, and the second ram arose and fled before it. Then I looked at the first ram until it fell before the dogs.",
      "89:48": "And the second ram arose and led the sheep.",
      "89:49": "And the sheep grew and multiplied, and all the dogs and foxes fled from it and feared it. And that ram butted and killed all the beasts, and those beasts did not prevail again among the sheep, nor did they snatch anything at all away from them. And that ram begot many sheep, and it fell asleep. And a little sheep became ram instead of it, and it became ruler and leader of those sheep.",
      "89:50": "And that house became large and broad. And a large and high tower was built upon that house for the Lord of the sheep. That house was low, but the tower was raised up and was high. And the Lord of the sheep stood on that tower, and they spread a full table before him.",
      "89:51": "And again I saw that those sheep strayed and went off in many paths and abandoned that house of theirs. And the Lord of the sheep summoned some from among the sheep and sent them to the sheep, and the sheep began to kill them,",
      "89:52": "but one of them escaped safely and was not killed. It sprang away and cried out over the sheep, and they wished to kill it; but the Lord of the sheep saved it from the hands of the sheep and brought it up to me and made it dwell (there).",
      "89:53": "And many other sheep he sent to those sheep to testify and lament over them.",
      "89:54": "After that I saw when they abandoned the house of the Lord and his tower, they went astray in everything, and their eyes were blinded. And I saw that the Lord of the sheep worked much slaughter on them in their pastures, <because> those sheep invited that slaughter and betrayed his place.",
      "89:55": "And he abandoned them into the hands of the lions and the leopards and the wolves and the hyenas and into the hands of the foxes and to all the beasts; and those wild beasts began to tear those sheep in pieces.",
      "89:56": "And I saw that he abandoned that house of theirs and their tower, and he threw them all into the hands of the lions so that they might tear them in pieces and devour them—into the hands of all the beasts.",
      "89:57": "And I began to cry out with all my might and to call to the Lord of the sheep and to show him concerning the sheep, because they were devoured by all the wild beasts.  58 And he was silent, though he saw (it), and he rejoiced because they were devoured and swallowed up and carried off, and he abandoned them into the hands of all the beasts as fodder.",
      "89:59": "And he summoned seventy shepherds, and he left those sheep to them, that they might pasture them. And he said to the shepherds and their subordinates, ‘Every one of you from now on shall pasture the sheep, and everything that I command you, do.",
      "89:60": "I am handing them over to you duly numbered, and I will tell you which of them are to be destroyed. Destroy them.’ And he handed those sheep over to them.",
      "89:61": "And another one he summoned and said to him, ‘Observe and see everything that the shepherds do against these sheep, for they will destroy more of them than I have commanded them.",
      "89:62": "Every excess and destruction that is done by the shepherds, write down—how many they destroy at my command, and how many they destroy on their own. Every destruction by each individual shepherd, write down against them.",
      "89:63": "And by number read them in my presence—how many they destroy and how many they hand over to destruction, so that I may have this testimony against them, that I may know every deed of the shepherds, that I may <measure> them and see what they are doing—whether they are acting according to the command that I gave them or not.",
      "89:64": "And do not let them know it, and do not show them or rebuke them. But write down every destruction by the shepherds, one by one, in his own time, and bring it all up to me.’",
      "89:65": "And I saw until those shepherds were pasturing <each> in his time, and they began to kill and destroy many more than they had been commanded, and they abandoned those sheep into the hands of the lions.  66 And the lions and leopards devoured and swallowed up most of those sheep, and the wild boars devoured along with them, and they burnt down that tower and demolished that house.",
      "89:67": "And I grieved exceedingly over that tower and because that house of the sheep had been demolished. And from then on I was unable to see whether those sheep were going into that house.",
      "89:68": "And the shepherds and their subordinates handed over those sheep to all the wild beasts, to devour them. And each of them, individually, in his time, was given over by number, and by number each of them handed over to his companion. In a book it was written how many of them he was destroying.",
      "89:69": "And more than was prescribed for them each of them was killing and destroying, and I began to weep and lament because of those sheep.  70 And thus in the vision I saw how that one who was writing was writing down each one that was being destroyed by those shepherds every day, and (how) he was bringing up and <spreading out> and showing that whole book to the Lord of the sheep, everything that they had done, and everything that each one of them had taken away, and everything that they had handed over to destruction.",
      "89:71": "And the book was read in the presence of the Lord of the sheep, and he took the book from his hand and read it and set it down.",
      "89:72": "<And I saw until> the shepherds were pasturing for twelve hours. And look, three of those sheep returned and came and entered and began to build all that had fallen down from that house. And the wild boars tried to hinder them, but they could not.",
      "89:73": "And they began again to build as before and they raised up that tower and it was called the high tower. And they began again to place a table before the tower, but all the bread on it was polluted and not pure.",
      "89:74": "And besides all these things, the eyes of the sheep were blind, and they did not see, and their shepherds likewise. And they handed them over to <the wild beasts> for greater destruction, and they trampled the sheep with their feet and devoured them.",
      "89:75": "And the Lord of the sheep remained silent until all the sheep were scattered over the field and were mixed with them, and they did not save them from the hand of the beasts.",
      "89:76": "And this one who was writing the book brought it up and showed it and read it in the houses of the Lord of the sheep. And he interceded with him in their behalf and petitioned him in their behalf, showing him every deed of the shepherds, and he testified in his presence against all the shepherds.",
      "89:77": "And he took the book and set it down by him and went out.",
      "90:1": "And I saw until the time when <thirty-five> shepherds had been pasturing in this manner, and they all completed their respective times like the first ones. And others received them into their hands to pasture them in their respective times, each shepherd in his time.",
      "90:2": "After this in my vision I saw all the birds of heaven come—eagles and vultures and kites and ravens, and the eagles were leading all the birds. And they began to devour those sheep and peck out their eyes and devour their flesh.",
      "90:3": "And the sheep cried out because their flesh was being devoured by the birds, and I cried out and lamented in my sleep because of that shepherd who was pasturing the sheep.",
      "90:4": "And I saw until those sheep were devoured by the dogs and by the eagles and by the kites. And they left them neither flesh nor skin nor sinew, until only their bones remained; and their bones fell on the earth, and the sheep became few.  5 And I saw until the time that twenty-three shepherds had been pasturing, and they completed in their respective times fifty-eight times.",
      "90:6": "And look, lambs were born of those white sheep, and they began to open their eyes and to see and to cry out to the sheep.  7 But they did not listen to them nor attend to their words, but they were extremely deaf, and their eyes were extremely and excessively blinded.  8 And I saw in the vision that the ravens flew upon those lambs and seized one of those lambs and dashed the sheep in pieces and devoured them.",
      "90:9": "And I saw until horns came out on those lambs, and the ravens were casting down their horns. And I saw until a great horn sprouted on one of those sheep.",

      "90:17": "And I looked at that man who wrote the book at the word of the Lord, until he opened the book of the destruction that those last twelve shepherds worked, and he showed before the Lord of the sheep that they had destroyed more than those before them.",
      "90:18": "And I saw until the Lord of the sheep came to them and took in his hand the staff of his wrath and struck the earth, and the earth was split, and all the beasts and all the birds of heaven fell (away) from among those sheep and sank in the earth, and it covered over them.",
      "90:19": "And I saw until a large sword was given to those sheep, and the sheep went out against all the wild beasts to kill them, and all the beasts and the birds of heaven fled before them.",
      "90:20": "And I saw until a throne was constructed in the pleasant land and the Lord of the sheep sat upon it, and he took all the sealed books and opened those books before the Lord of the sheep.",

      "90:24": "And judgment was exacted first on the stars, and they were judged and found to be sinners. And they went to the place of ­judgment, and they threw them into an abyss; and it was full of fire, and it was burning and was full of ­pillars of fire.",
      "90:25": "And those seventy shepherds were judged and found to be sinners, and they were thrown into that fiery abyss.",
      "90:26": "And I saw at that time that an abyss like it was opened in the middle of the earth, which was full of fire. And they brought those blinded sheep, and they were all judged and found to be sinners. And they were thrown into that fiery abyss, and they burned. And that abyss was to the south of that house.",

      "103:7": "Know that down to Sheol they will lead your souls; and there they will be in great distress,",
      "103:8": "and in darkness and in a snare and in a flaming fire. Into great judgment your souls will enter, and the great judgment will be for all the generations of eternity. Woe to you, you will have no peace.",
      "103:9": "Do not say, you who are righteous and pious in life, “In the days of our tribulation, we toiled laboriously, and every tribulation we saw, and many evils we found. We were consumed and became few, and our spirits, small;",
      "103:10": "and we were destroyed and there was no one to help us with word and deed; we were powerless and found nothing. We were crushed and destroyed, and we gave up hope any more to know safety from day to day;",
      "103:11": "we had hoped to be the head and became the tail. We toiled and labored and were not masters of our labor; we became the food of the sinners. The lawless weighed down their yoke upon us;",
      "103:12": "our enemies were our masters, they goaded us on and penned us in, and to our enemies we bowed our necks, and they had no mercy on us.",
      "103:13": "We sought to get away from them, so that we might escape and be refreshed; but we found no place to flee and be safe from them.",

      "103:15": "They did not help us, they did not find (anything) against those who oppressed us and devoured us. But they strengthened against us them who killed us and made us few. They did not disclose their iniquities, nor did they remove from us the yoke of them who devoured us and dispersed us and murdered us. They did not disclose concerning those who murdered us, nor did they make mention that they raised their hands against us.”",

      "104:9": "Do not err in your hearts or lie, or alter the words of truth, or falsify the words of the Holy One, or give praise to your errors. For it is not to righteousness that all your lies and all your error lead, but to great sin.",

      "104:11": "Would that they would write all my words in truth, and neither remove nor alter these words, but write in truth all that I testify to them.",
      "104:12": "And again I know a second mystery, that to the righteous and pious and wise my books will be given for the joy of righteousness and much wisdom.",
      "104:13": "Indeed, to them the books will be given, and they will believe in them, and in them all the righteous will rejoice and be glad, to learn from them all the paths of truth.",
      "105:1": "In those days, says the Lord, they will summon and testify against the sons of earth in their wisdom. Instruct them, for you are their leaders and . . . rewards over all the earth.",
      "105:2": "For I and my son will join ourselves with them forever in the paths of truth in their life. And you will have peace. Rejoice, O children of truth. Amen.",
      "106:1": "After a time, I took a wife for Methuselah my son, and she bore a son and called his name Lamech. Righteousness was brought low until that day. And when (Lamech) had come of age, he took for himself a wife, and she conceived from him and bore a child.",
      "106:2": "And when the child was born, his body was whiter than snow and redder than a rose, his hair was all white and like white wool and curly. Glorious <was his face>. When he opened his eyes, the house shone like the sun.",
      "106:3": "And he stood up from the hands of the midwife, and he opened his mouth and praised the Lord <of eternity>.",
      "106:4": "And Lamech was afraid of him, and he fled and came to Methuselah his father.",
      "106:5": "And he said to him, “A strange child has been born to me. He is not like human beings, but (like) the sons of the angels of heaven. His form is strange, not like us. His eyes are like the rays of the sun, and glorious is his face.",
      "106:6": "I think that he is not from me, but from the angels. And I fear him, lest something happen in his days on the earth.",

      "106:9": "He answered and said, “Because of great distress I have come to you, and because of a terrible vision I have approached here, father.",
      "106:10": "And now, my father, hear me, for a child has been born to Lamech my son, and his form and appearance are not like the form of human beings. And his color is whiter than snow and redder than a rose, and the hair of his head is whiter than white wool. And his eyes are like the rays of the sun, and he opened his eyes and made the whole house bright.",
      "106:11": "And he stood up from the hands of the midwife, and he opened his mouth and praised the Lord of eternity.",
      "106:12": "And Lamech my son was afraid and he fled to me. He does not believe that (the child) is his son, but that (he is) from the angels of heaven. And, look, I have come to you, because from the angels you have the exact facts and the truth.”",
      "106:13": "Then I, Enoch, answered and said, “The Lord will renew his commandment upon the earth, just as, child, I have seen and told you. That in the generation of Jared, my father, they transgressed the word of the Lord/the covenant of heaven,",
      "106:14": "and look, they went on sinning and transgressing the custom. With women they were mingling, and with them they were sinning. They married some of them, and they went on begetting (children), not like spirits, but of flesh.",
      "106:15": "And there will be great wrath upon the earth and a flood, and there will be great destruction for a year.",

      "106:17": "And he will cleanse the earth from the corruption that is on it.",
      "106:18": "And now tell Lamech, ‘He is your child in truth, and <this child will be righteous and> blameless, <And “Noah”> call his name, for he will be your remnant, from whom you will find rest.’ He and his sons will be saved from the corruption of the earth and from all sins and from all iniquities that are consummated on the earth in his days.",
      "106:19": "And after this there will be stronger iniquity than that which was formerly consummated on the earth. (For I know the mysteries <of the Lord> that the holy ones have revealed and shown to me, and that I have read in the tablets of heaven.",
      "107:1": "And I have seen written in them that generation upon generation will do evil in this way, and the evil will be until there arise generations of righ­teousness.) And evil and wickedness will end, and violence will cease from the earth, and good things will come upon the earth to them.",
      "107:2": "Now go, child, and tell Lamech your son that this child that has been born is his child, truly and without deception.”",
      "107:3": "When Methuselah heard the words of Enoch his father—for (Enoch) revealed them to him secretly—(Methuselah) returned and revealed everything to (Lamech). And his name was called Noah— he who gladdens the earth from destruction.",
      "108:1": "Another book that Enoch wrote for his son Methuselah and for those who would come after him and keep the law in the last days.",
      "108:2": "You who have observed (it) and are waiting in these days until the evildoers are brought to an end and the power of the sinners is brought to an end—  3 you wait until sin passes away. For their names will be erased from the book of life and from the books of the holy ones, and their descendants will perish forever; their spirits will be slaughtered, and they will cry out and groan in a desolate, unseen place, and in fire they will burn, for there is no earth there.",
      "108:4": "I saw there something like a cloud, which could not be discerned, since because of its depth I was unable to look up at it. And flames of fire I saw burning gloriously, and something like glorious mountains were turning over and quaking to and fro.",
      "108:5": "And I asked one of the holy angels who were with me, “What is this glorious (place), for there is no heaven, but only flames of fire that are burning and the sound of weeping and crying and groaning and severe pain.”",
      "108:6": "And he said to me, “The place that you see—here are thrown the spirits of the sinners and blasphemers and those who do evil and those who alter everything that the Lord has said by the mouth of the prophets (about) the things that will be done.",
      "108:7": "For there are books and records about them in heaven above, so that the angels may read them and know what will happen to the sinners and the spirits of the humble, and those who afflicted their bodies, and were recompensed by God; and those who were abused by evil men;",
      "108:8": "those who love God, and do not love gold and silver and all the good things that are in the world; but gave their bodies to torment;",
      "108:9": "and those who from the time they existed did not desire the food that is in the world, but considered themselves as a breath that passes away; and to this they kept. The Lord tested them much, and their spirits were found pure, so that they might bless his name.",
      "108:10": "And all their blessings I have recounted in the books. And he has recompensed them for their lives, for these were found to have loved heaven more than their life that is in the world. Although they were trampled down by evil men and heard reproach and insult from them and were abused, yet they blessed me.",
      "108:11": "And now I will summon the spirits of the pious (who are) from the generation of light; and I will transform those who <have descended into> darkness, who in their bodies were not recompensed with the honor appropriate to their faithfulness.",
      "108:12": "Indeed, I will bring forth in shining light those who loved my holy name, and I will seat each one on the throne of his honor,",
      "108:13": "and they will shine for times without number. For righteous is the judgment of God, and to the faithful he shows faithfulness, because they abide in the paths of truth.",
      "108:14": "And the righteous, as they shine, will see those who were born in darkness cast into darkness;",
      "108:15": "and the sinners will cry out and see them shining; and they, for their part, will depart to where the days and times are written for them."
