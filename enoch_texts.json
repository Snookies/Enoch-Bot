        "18:16": "And he was wroth with them and bound them until the time of the completion of their sin in the year of mystery.”",
        "19:1": "And Uriel said to me, “Here shall stand in many different appearances the spirits of the angels which have united themselves with women. They have defiled the people and will lead them into error so that they will offer sacrifices to the demons as unto gods, until the great day of judgment in which they shall be judged till they are finished.",
        "19:2": "And their women whom the angels have led astray will be peaceful ones.”",
        "19:3": "(So) I, Enoch, I saw the vision of the end of everything alone; and none among human beings will see as I have seen.",
        "20:1": "And these are names of the holy angels who watch:",
        "20:2": "Suruʾel, one of the holy angels—for (he is) of eternity and of trembling.",
        "20:3": "Raphael, one of the holy angels, for (he is) of the spirits of man.",
        "20:4": "Raguel, one of the holy angels who take vengeance for the world and for the luminaries.",
        "20:5": "Michael, one of the holy angels, for (he is) obedient in his benevolence over the people and the nations.",
        "20:6": "Saraqaʾel, one of the holy angels who are (set) over the spirits of mankind who sin in the spirit.",
        "20:7": "Gabriel, one of the holy angels who oversee the garden of Eden, and the serpents, and the cherubim.",
        "21:1": "And I came to an empty place.",
        "21:2": "And I saw (there) neither a heaven above nor an earth below, but a chaotic and terrible place.",
        "21:3": "And there I saw seven stars of heaven bound together in it, like great mountains, and burning with fire.",
        "21:4": "At that moment I said, “For which sin are they bound, and for what reason were they cast in here.”",
        "21:5": "Then one of the holy angels, Uriel, who was with me, guiding me, spoke to me and said to me, “Enoch, for what reason are you asking and for what reason do you question and exhibit eagerness?",
        "21:6": "These are among the stars of heaven which have transgressed the commandments of the Lord and are bound in this place until the completion of ten million years, (according) to the number of their sins.”",
        "21:7": "I then proceeded from that area to another place which is even more terrible and saw a terrible thing: a great fire that was burning and flaming; the place had a cleavage (that extended) to the last sea, pouring out great pillars of fire; neither its extent nor its magnitude could I see nor was I able to estimate.",
        "21:8": "At that moment, what a terrible opening is this place and a pain to look at!",
        "21:9": "Then Uraʾel, (one) of the holy angels who was with me, responded and said to me, “Enoch, why are you afraid like this?” (I answered and said),”",
        "21:10": "“I am frightened because of this terrible place and the spectacle of this painful thing.” And he said unto me, “This place is the prison house of the angels; they are detained here forever.”",
        "22:1": "Then went to another place, and he showed me on the west side a great and high mountain of hard rock",
        "22:2": "and inside it four beautiful corners; it had [in it] a deep, wide, and smooth (thing) which was rolling over; and it (the place) was deep and dark to look at. 3At that moment, Rufael, one of the holy angels, who was with me, responded to me; and he said to me, “These beautiful corners (are here) in order that the spirits of the souls of the dead should assemble into them—they are created so that the souls of the children of the people should gather here.",
        "22:4": "They prepared these places in order to put them (i.e. the souls of the people) there until the day of their judgment and the appointed time of the great judgment upon them.”",
        "22:5": "I saw the spirits of the children of the people who were dead, and their voices were reaching unto heaven until this very moment.",
        "22:6": "I asked Rufael, the angel who was with me, and said to him, “This spirit, the voice of which is reaching (into heaven) like this and is making suit, whose (spirit) is it?”",
        "22:7": "And he answered me, saying, “This is the spirit which had left Abel, whom Cain, his brother, had killed; it (continues to) sue him until all of (Cain’s) seed is exterminated from the face of the earth, and his seed has disintegrated from among the seed of the people.”",
        "22:8": "At that moment, I raised a question regarding him and regarding the judgment of all, “For what reason is one separated from the other?”",
        "22:9": "And he replied and said to me, “These three have been made in order that the spirits of the dead might be separated. And in the manner in which the souls of the righteous are separated (by) this spring of water with light upon it,",
        "22:10": "in like manner, the sinners are set apart when they die and are buried in the earth and judgment has not been executed upon them in their lifetime,",
        "22:11": "upon this great pain, until the great day of judgment—and to those who curse (there will be) plague and pain forever, and the retribution of their spirits. They will bind them there forever—even if from the beginning of the world.",
        "22:12": "And in this manner is a separation made for the souls of those who make the suit (and) those who disclose concerning destruction, as they were killed in the days of the sinners.",
        "22:13": "Such has been made for the souls of the people who are not righteous, but sinners and perfect criminals; they shall be together with (other) criminals who are like them, (whose) souls will not be killed on the day of judgment but will not rise from there.”",
        "22:14": "At that moment I blessed the Lord of Glory and I said, “Blessed be my Lord, the Lord of righteousness who rules forever.”",
        "23:1": "And from there I (departed and) went to another place in the direction of the west until the (extreme) ends of the earth.",
        "23:2": "And I saw a burning fire which was running without rest; and it did not diminish its speed night and day.",
        "23:3": "And I asked, saying, “What is this (thing) which has no rest?”",
        "23:4": "At that moment, Raguel, one of the holy angels, who was with me, answered me and said to me, “This (thing) which you saw is the course (of the fire) and this, the fire which is burning in the direction of the west, is the luminaries of heaven.”",
        "24:1": "From there I went to another place of the earth, and he showed me a mountain of fire which was flaming day and night.",
        "24:2": "And I went in its direction and saw seven dignified mountains—all different one from the other, of precious and beautiful stones, and all dignified and glorious in respect to their visualization and beautiful in respect to their facade—three in the direction of the east, one founded on the other, and three in the direction of the north, one upon the other, with deep and crooked ravines, each one (of which) is removed from the other.",
        "24:3": "The seven mountains were (situated) in the midst of these (ravines) and (in respect to) their heights all resembled the seat of a throne (which is) surrounded by fragrant trees.",
        "24:4": "And among them, there was one tree such as I have never at all smelled; there was not a single one among those or other (trees) which is like it; among all the fragrances nothing could be so fragrant; its leaves, its flowers, and its wood would never wither forever; its fruit is beautiful and resembles the clustered fruits of a palm tree.",
        "24:5": "At that moment I said, “This is a beautiful tree, beautiful to view, with leaves (so) handsome and blossoms (so) magnificant in appearance.”",
        "24:6": "Then Michael, one of the holy and revered angels—he is their chief—who was with me, responded to me.",
        "25:1": "And he said unto me, Enoch, “What is it that you are asking me concerning the fragrance of this tree and you are so inquisitive about?”",
        "25:2": "At that moment, I answered, saying, “I am desirous of knowing everything, but specially about this thing.”",
        "25:3": "He answered, saying, “This tall mountain which you saw whose summit resembles the throne of God is (indeed) his throne, on which the Holy and Great Lord of Glory, the Eternal King, will sit when he descends to visit the earth with goodness.",
        "25:4": "And as for this fragrant tree, not a single human being has the authority to touch it until the great judgment, when he shall take vengeance on all and conclude (everything) forever.",
        "25:5": "This is for the righteous and the pious. And the elect will be presented with its fruit for life. He will plant it in the direction of the northeast, upon the holy place—in the direction of the house of the Lord, the Eternal King.",
        "25:6": "Then they shall be glad and rejoice in gladness, and they shall enter into the holy (place); its fragrance shall (penetrate) their bones, long life will they live on earth, such as your fathers lived in their days.”",
        "25:7": "At that moment, I blessed the God of Glory, the Eternal King, for he has prepared such things for the righteous people, as he had created (them) and given it to them.",
        "26:1": "And from there I went into the center of the earth and saw a blessed place, shaded with branches which live and bloom from a tree that was cut.",
        "26:2": "And there I saw a holy mountain; underneath the mountain, in the direction of the east, there was a stream which was flowing in the direction of the north.",
        "26:3": "And I saw in a second direction, (another) mountain which was higher than (the former). Between them was a deep and narrow valley. In the direction of the (latter) mountain ran a stream.",
        "26:4": "In the direction of the west from this one there was (yet) another mountain, smaller than it and not so high, with a valley under it, and between them besides, (another) valley which is deep and dry.",
        "26:5": "(The valleys) were narrow, (formed) of hard rocks and no tree growing on them.",
        "26:6": "And I marveled at the mountain(s) and I marveled at the valley(s): I marveled very deeply.",
        "27:1": "At that moment, I said, “For what purpose does this blessed land, entirely filled with trees, (have) in its midst this accursed valley?”",
        "27:2": "Then, Uriel, one of the holy angels, who was with me, answered me and said to me, “This accursed valley is for those accursed forever; here will gather together all (those) accursed ones, those who speak with their mouth unbecoming words against the Lord and utter hard words concerning his glory. Here shall they be gathered together, and here shall be their judgment, in the last days.",
        "27:3": "There will be upon them the spectacle of the righteous judgment, in the presence of the righteous forever. The merciful will bless the Lord of Glory, the Eternal King, all the day.",
        "27:4": "In the days of the judgment of (the accursed), the (merciful) shall bless him for the mercy which he had bestowed upon them.”",
        "27:5": "At that moment, I blessed the Lord of Glory and gave him the praise that befits his glory.",
        "28:1": "And from there I went in the direction of the east into the center of the mountain of the desert; and I saw a wilderness and it was solitary, full of trees and seeds.",
        "28:2": "And there was a stream on top of it, and it gushed forth from above it.",
        "28:3": "It appeared like a waterfall which cascaded greatly as if toward the direction of west of the northeast; water and dew ascended from it all over.",
        "29:1": "Then I went into another place in the desert; and I approached the easterly direction of this mountain.",
        "29:2": "And there I saw the tree of judgment (which has) the smell of rubbish; its tree looked like that of frankincense and myrrh.",
        "30:1": "And beyond it—beyond those above the easterly mountains—it is not far. And I saw a place which is a valley of water that is endless.",
        "30:2": "And I saw a beautiful tree which resembles a tree whose fragrance is like that of mastic.",
        "30:3": "And in the direction of the sides of those valleys, I saw a fragrant cinnamon tree. And over these, I proceeded in the easterly direction.",
        "31:1": "And I saw other mountains with trees in them. There flowed from them (the trees) something like nectar, called sarara and galbanum.",
        "31:2": "And over these mountains, I saw (yet) another mountain and in it there were aloe trees, and the whole forest was full of (trees) like sturdy almond trees.",
        "31:3": "And when one picks the fruit it gives the most pleasant odor.",
        "32:1": "And after (experiencing) this fragrant odor, while looking toward the northeast over the mountains, I saw seven mountains full of excellent nard, fragrant trees, cinnamon trees, and pepper.",
        "32:2": "From there I went over the summits of the mountains, far toward the east of the earth. I (then) passed over the Erythraean Sea and went far from it, and passed over the head of angel Zutuʾel.",
        "32:3": "And I came to the garden of righteousness and saw beyond those trees many (other) large (ones) growing there—their fragrance sweet, large ones, with much elegance, and glorious. And the tree of wisdom, of which one eats and knows great wisdom, (was among them).",
        "32:4": "It looked like the colors of the carob tree, its fruit like very beautiful grape clusters, and the fragrance of this tree travels and reaches afar.",
        "32:5": "And I said, “This tree is beautiful and its appearance beautiful and pleasant!”",
        "32:6": "Then the holy angel Raphael, who was with me, responded to me and said, “This very thing is the tree of wisdom from which your old father and aged mother, they who are your precursors, ate and came to know wisdom; and (consequently) their eyes were opened and they realized that they were naked and (so) they were expelled from the garden.”",
        "33:1": "And from there I went to the extreme ends of the earth and saw there huge beasts, each different from the other—and different birds (also) differing from one another in appearance, beauty, and voice. And to the east of those beasts, I saw the ultimate ends of the earth which rests on the heaven.",
        "33:2": "And the gates of heaven were open, and I saw how the stars of heaven come out;",
        "33:3": "and I counted the gates out of which they exit and wrote down all their exits for each one: according to their numbers, their names, their ranks, their seats, their periods, their months, as Uriel, the holy angel who was with me, showed me.",
        "33:4": "He showed me all things and wrote them down for me—also in addition he wrote down their names, their laws, and their companies.",
        "34:1": "From there I went in the direction of the north, to the extreme ends of the earth, and there at the extreme end of the whole world I saw a great and glorious seat.",
        "34:2": "There (also) I saw three open gates of heaven; when it blows cold, hail, frost, snow, dew, and rain, through each one of the (gates) the winds proceed in the northwesterly direction.",
        "34:3": "Through one gate they blow good things; but when they blow with force through the two (other) gates, they blow violence and sorrow upon the earth.",
        "35:1": "And from there I went in the direction of the west to the extreme ends of the earth, and saw there three open gates of heaven, (just) like the one that I saw in the east in respect to the number of its exits.",
        "36:1": "And from there I went in the direction of the south to the extreme ends of the earth, and saw there three open gates of the heaven from where the south wind, dew, rain, and wind come forth.",
        "36:2": "From there I went in the direction of the extreme ends of the heaven and saw there open gates of heaven, with small gates above them, in the direction of the east.",
        "36:3": "Through one of these small gates pass the stars of heaven and travel westward on the path which is shown to them.",
        "36:4": "And when I saw (this) I blessed—and I shall always bless—the Lord of Glory, who performed great and blessed miracles in order that he may manifest his great deeds to his angels, the winds, and to the people so that they might praise the effect of all his creation—so that they might see the effect of his power and praise him in respect to the great work of his hands and bless him forever.",
        "37:1": "Book two: The vision which Enoch saw the second time—the vision of wisdom which Enoch, son of Jared, son of Mahalalel, son of Kenan, son of Enosh, son of Seth, son of Adam, saw:",
        "37:2": "This is the beginning of the words of wisdom which I commenced to propound, saying to those who dwell in the earth, “Listen, you first ones, and look, you last ones, the words of the Holy One, which I teach before the Lord of the Spirits.",
        "37:3": "It is good to declare these words to those of former times, but one should not withhold the beginning of wisdom from those of latter days.",
        "37:4": "Until now such wisdom, which I have received as I recited (it) in accordance with the will of the Lord of the Spirits, had not been bestowed upon me before the face of the Lord of the Spirits. From him, the lot of eternal life has been given to me.",
        "37:5": "Three things were imparted to me”; and I began to recount them to those who dwell upon the earth.",
        "38:1": "The first thing: When the congregation of the righteous shall appear, sinners shall be judged for their sins, they shall be driven from the face of the earth,",
        "38:2": "and when the Righteous One shall appear before the face of the righteous, those elect ones, their deeds are hung upon the Lord of the Spirits, he shall reveal light to the righteous and the elect who dwell upon the earth, where will the dwelling of the sinners be, and where the resting place of those who denied the name of the Lord of the Spirits? It would have been better for them not to have been born.",
        "38:3": "When the secrets of the Righteous One are revealed, he shall judge the sinners; and the wicked ones will be driven from the presence of the righteous and the elect,",
        "38:4": "and from that time, those who possess the earth will neither be rulers nor princes, they shall not be able to behold the faces of the holy ones, for the light of the Lord of the Spirits has shined upon the face of the holy, the righteous, and the elect.",
        "38:5": "At that moment, kings and rulers shall perish, they shall be delivered into the hands of the righteous and holy ones,",
        "38:6": "and from thenceforth no one shall be able to induce the Lord of the Spirits to show them mercy, for their life is annihilated.",
        "39:1": "And it shall come to pass in those days that the children of the elect and the holy ones [will descend] from the high heaven and their seed will become one with the children of the people.",
        "39:2": "And in those days Enoch received the books of zeal and wrath as well as the books of haste and whirlwind. The Lord of the Spirits says that mercy shall not be upon them.",
        "39:3": "In those days, whirlwinds carried me off from the earth, and set me down into the ultimate ends of the heavens.",
        "39:4": "There I saw other dwelling places of the holy ones and their resting places too.",
        "39:5": "So there my eyes saw their dwelling places with the holy angels, and their resting places with the holy ones, and they interceded and petitioned and prayed on behalf of the children of the people, and righteousness flowed before them like water, and mercy like dew upon the earth, and thus it is in their midst forever and ever.",
        "39:6": "And in those days my eyes saw the Elect One of righteousness and of faith, and righteousness shall prevail in his days, and the righteous and elect ones shall be without number before him forever and ever.",
        "39:7": "And I saw a dwelling place underneath the wings of the Lord of the Spirits; and all the righteous and the elect before him shall be as intense as the light of fire. Their mouth shall be full of blessing; and their lips will praise the name of the Lord of the Spirits, and righteousness before him will have no end; and uprightness before him will not cease.",
        "39:8": "There (underneath his wings) I wanted to dwell; and my soul desired that dwelling place. Already my portion is there; for thus has it been reserved for me before the Lord of the Spirits.",
        "39:9": "In those days, I praised and prayed to the name of the Lord of the Spirits with blessings and praises, for he had strengthened me by blessings and praises in accordance with the will of the Lord of the Spirits.",
        "39:10": "And I gazed at that place (under his wings), and I blessed and praised, saying, “Blessed is he, and may he be blessed, from the beginning and forever more.",
        "39:11": "There is no such thing as non-existence before him. (Even) before the world was created, he knows what is forever and what will be from generation to generation.",
        "39:12": "Those who do not slumber but stand before your glory, did bless you. They shall bless, praise, and extol (you), saying, ‘Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord of the Spirits; the spirits fill the earth.’ ”",
        "39:13": "And at that place (under his wings) my eyes saw others who stood before him sleepless (and) blessed (him), saying,",
        "39:14": "“Blessed are you and blessed is the name of the Lord of the Spirits forever and ever.” And my face was changed on account of the fact that I could not withstand the sight.",
        "40:1": "And after that, I saw a hundred thousand times a hundred thousand, ten million times ten million, an innumerable and uncountable (multitude) who stand before the glory of the Lord of the Spirits.",
        "40:2": "I saw them standing—on the four wings of the Lord of the Spirits—and saw four other faces among those who do not slumber, and I came to know their names, which the angel who came with me revealed to me; and he (also) showed me all the hidden things.",
        "40:3": "(Then) I heard the voices of those four faces while they were saying praises before the Lord of Glory.",
        "40:4": "The first voice was blessing the name of the Lord of the Spirits.",
        "40:5": "The second voice I heard blessing the Elect One and the elect ones who are clinging onto the Lord of the Spirits.",
        "40:6": "And the third voice I heard interceding and praying on behalf of those who dwell upon the earth and supplicating in the name of the Lord of the Spirits.",
        "40:7": "And the fourth voice I heard expelling the demons and forbidding them from coming to the Lord of the Spirits in order to accuse those who dwell upon the earth.",
        "40:8": "And after that, I asked the angel of peace, who was going with me and showed me everything that was hidden, “Who are these four faces which I have seen and whose voices I have heard and written down?”",
        "40:9": "And he said to me, “The first one is the merciful and forbearing Michael; the second one, who is set over all disease and every wound of the children of the people, is Raphael; the third, who is set over all exercise of strength, is Gabriel; and the fourth, who is set over all actions of repentance unto the hope of those who would inherit eternal life, is Phanuel by name.”",
        "40:10": "(So) these are his four angels: they are of the Lord of the Spirits, and the four voices which I heard in those days.",
        "41:1": "And after that, I saw all the secrets in heaven, and how a kingdom breaks up, and how the actions of the people are weighed in the balance.",
        "41:2": "And there I saw the dwelling place of the sinners and the company of the holy ones; and my eyes saw the sinners—those who deny the name of the Lord of the Spirits—being expelled from there and being dragged off; and they could not stand still because of the plague which proceeds forth from the Lord of the Spirits.",
        "41:3": "And there my eyes saw the secrets of lightning and thunder, and the mysteries of the winds, how they are distributed in order to blow upon the earth, and the secrets of the clouds and the dew I saw there from where they proceed in that place and (how) from there they satiate the dust of the earth.",
        "41:4": "At that place, I (also) saw sealed storerooms from which the winds of the storerooms of hail and the winds of the storerooms of mist are distributed; and these clouds hover over the earth from the beginning of the world.",
        "41:5": "And I saw the storerooms of the sun and the moon, from what place they come out and to which place they return, and their glorious return—how in their travel one festival is celebrated more than the other. They do not depart from their orbit, neither increase nor decrease it; but they keep faith one with another: in accordance with an oath they set and they rise.",
        "41:6": "From the first is the sun; and it executes its course in accordance with the commandment of the Lord of the Spirits—his name shall persist forever and ever.",
        "41:7": "After that is found (both) the hidden and the visible path of the moon; and the path of its orbit it completes by day and by night at that place. And the two will gaze directly into the glory of the Lord of the Spirits. They give thanks, they praise, and they do not economize (on energy), for their very essence generates new power.",
        "41:8": "Surely the many changes of the sun have (both) a blessing and a curse, and the course of the moon’s path is light to the righteous (on the one hand) and darkness to the sinners (on the other), in the name of the Lord of the Spirits, who created the distinction between light and darkness and separated the spirits of the people, and strengthened the spirits of the righteous in the name of his righteousness.",
        "41:9": "Surely, neither an angel nor Satan has the power to hinder; for there is a judge to all of them, he will glance, and all of them are before him, he is the judge.",
        "42:1": "Wisdom could not find a place in which she could dwell; but a place was found (for her) in the heavens.",
        "42:2": "Then Wisdom went out to dwell with the children of the people, but she found no dwelling place. (So) Wisdom returned to her place and she settled permanently among the angels.",
        "42:3": "Then Iniquity went out of her rooms, and found whom she did not expect. And she dwelt with them, like rain in a desert, like dew on a thirsty land.",
        "43:1": "And I saw other lightnings and the stars of heaven. And I saw how he called them each by their (respective) names, and they obeyed him.",
        "43:2": "And I saw the impartial scales for the purpose of balancing their lights at their widest areas. And their natures are as follows: Their revolutions produce lightning; and in number they are (as many as) the angels; they keep their faith each one according to their names.",
        "43:3": "And I asked the angel who was going with me and who had shown me the secret things, “What are these things?”",
        "43:4": "And he said to me, “The Lord of the Spirits has shown you the prototype of each one of them: These are the names of the holy ones who dwell upon the earth and believe in the name of the Lord of the Spirits forever and ever.”",
        "44:1": "And I saw another thing regarding lightning: how some stars arise and become lightning and cannot dwell with the rest.",
        "45:1": "This is the second parable concerning those who deny the name of the Lord of the Spirits and the congregation of the holy ones.",
        "45:2": "Neither will they ascend into heaven, nor will they reach the ground; such will be the lot of the sinners, who will deny the name of the Lord of the Spirits, those who in this manner will be preserved for the day of burden and tribulation.",
        "45:3": "On that day, my Elect One shall sit on the seat of glory and make a selection of their deeds, their resting places will be without number, their souls shall be firm within them when they see my Elect One, those who have appealed to my glorious name,",
        "45:4": "On that day, I shall cause my Elect One to dwell among them, I shall transform heaven and make it a blessing of light forever.",
        "45:5": "I shall (also) transform the earth and make it a blessing, and cause my Elect One to dwell in her. Then those who have committed sin and crime shall not set foot in her.",
        "45:6": "For in peace I have looked (with favor) upon my righteous ones and given them mercy, and have caused them to dwell before me. But sinners have come before me so that by judgment I shall destroy them from before the face of the earth.",
        "46:1": "At that place, I saw the One to whom belongs the time before time. And his head was white like wool, and there was with him another individual, whose face was like that of a human being. His countenance was full of grace like that of one among the holy angels.",
        "46:2": "And I asked the one—from among the angels—who was going with me, and who had revealed to me all the secrets regarding the One who was born of human beings, “Who is this, and from whence is he who is going as the prototype of the Before-Time?”",
        "46:3": "And he answered me and said to me, “This is the Son of Man, to whom belongs righteousness, and with whom righteousness dwells. And he will open all the hidden storerooms; for the Lord of the Spirits has chosen him, and he is destined to be victorious before the Lord of the Spirits in eternal uprightness.",
        "46:4": "This Son of Man whom you have seen is the One who would remove the kings and the mighty ones from their comfortable seats and the strong ones from their thrones. He shall loosen the reins of the strong and crush the teeth of the sinners.",
        "46:5": "He shall depose the kings from their thrones and kingdoms. For they do not extol and glorify him, and neither do they obey him, the source of their kingship.",
        "46:6": "The faces of the strong will be slapped and be filled with shame and gloom. Their dwelling places and their beds will be worms. They shall have no hope to rise from their beds, for they do not extol the name of the Lord of the Spirits.",
        "46:7": "And they have become the judges of the stars of heaven; they raise their hands (to reach) the Most High while walking upon the earth and dwelling in her. They manifest all their deeds in oppression; all their deeds are oppression. Their power (depends) upon their wealth. And their devotion is to the gods which they have fashioned with their own hands. But they deny the name of the Lord of the Spirits.",
        "46:8": "Yet they like to congregate in his houses and (with) the faithful ones who cling to the Lord of the Spirits.",
        "47:1": "“In those days, the prayers of the righteous ascended into heaven, and the blood of the righteous from the earth before the Lord of the Spirits.",
        "47:2": "There shall be days when all the holy ones who dwell in the heavens above shall dwell (together). And with one voice, they shall supplicate and pray—glorifying, praising, and blessing the name of the Lord of the Spirits—on behalf of the blood of the righteous ones which has been shed. Their prayers shall not stop from exhaustion before the Lord of the Spirits—neither will they relax forever—(until) judgment is executed for them.”",
        "47:3": "In those days, I saw him—the Antecedent of Time, while he was sitting upon the throne of his glory, and the books of the living ones were open before him. And all his power in heaven above and his escorts stood before him.",
        "47:4": "The hearts of the holy ones are filled with joy, because the number of the righteous has been offered, the prayers of the righteous ones have been heard, and the blood of the righteous has been admitted before the Lord of the Spirits.",
        "48:1": "Furthermore, in that place I saw the fountain of righteousness, which does not become depleted and is surrounded completely by numerous fountains of wisdom. All the thirsty ones drink (of the water) and become filled with wisdom. (Then) their dwelling places become with the holy, righteous, and elect ones.",
        "48:2": "At that hour, that Son of Man was given a name, in the presence of the Lord of the Spirits, the Before Time;",
        "48:3": "even before the creation of the sun and the moon, before the creation of the stars, he was given a name in the presence of the Lord of the Spirits.",
        "48:4": "He will become a staff for the righteous ones in order that they may lean on him and not fall. He is the light of the gentiles and he will become the hope of those who are sick in their hearts.",
        "48:5": "All those who dwell upon the earth shall fall and worship before him; they shall glorify, bless, and sing the name of the Lord of the Spirits.",
        "48:6": "For this purpose he became the Chosen One; he was concealed in the presence of (the Lord of the Spirits) prior to the creation of the world, and for eternity.",
        "48:7": "And he has revealed the wisdom of the Lord of the Spirits to the righteous and the holy ones, for he has preserved the portion of the righteous because they have hated and despised this world of oppression (together with) all its ways of life and its habits in the name of the Lord of the Spirits; and because they will be saved in his name and it is his good pleasure that they have life.",
        "48:8": "In those days, the kings of the earth and the mighty landowners shall be humiliated on account of the deeds of their hands. Therefore, on the day of their misery and weariness, they will not be able to save themselves.",
        "48:9": "I shall deliver them into the hands of my elect ones like grass in the fire and like lead in the water, so they shall burn before the face of the holy ones and sink before their sight, and no place will be found for them.",
        "48:10": "On the day of their weariness, there shall be an obstacle on the earth and they shall fall on their faces; and they shall not rise up (again), nor anyone (be found) who will take them with his hands and raise them up. For they have denied the Lord of the Spirits and his Messiah. Blessed be the name of the Lord of the Spirits!",
        "49:1": "So wisdom flows like water and glory is measureless before him forever and ever.",
        "49:2": "For his might is in all the mysteries of righteousness, and oppression will vanish like a shadow having no foundation. The Elect One stands before the Lord of the Spirits; his glory is forever and ever and his power is unto all generations.",
        "49:3": "In him dwells the spirit of wisdom, the spirit which gives thoughtfulness, the spirit of knowledge and strength, and the spirit of those who have fallen asleep in righteousness.",
        "49:4": "He shall judge the secret things. And no one will be able to utter vain words in his presence. For he is the Elect One before the Lord of the Spirits according to his good pleasure.",
        "50:1": "In those days, there will be a change for the holy and the righteous ones and the light of days shall rest upon them; and glory and honor shall be given back to the holy ones, on the day of weariness.",
        "50:2": "He heaped evil upon the sinners; but the righteous ones shall be victorious in the name of the Lord of the Spirits. He will cause the others to see this so that they may repent and forsake the deeds of their hands.",
        "50:3": "There shall not be honor unto them in the name of the Lord of the Spirits. But through his name they shall be saved, and the Lord of the Spirits shall have mercy upon them, for his mercy is considerable.",
        "50:4": "He is righteous in his judgment and in the glory that is before him. Oppression cannot survive his judgment; and the unrepentant in his presence shall perish.",
        "50:5": "The Lord of the Spirits has said that from henceforth he will not have mercy on them.",
        "51:1": "In those days, Sheol will return all the deposits which she had received and hell will give back all that which it owes.",
        "51:2": "And he shall choose the righteous and the holy ones from among (the risen dead), for the day when they shall be selected and saved has arrived.",
        "51:3": "In those days, (the Elect One)f shall sit on my throne, and from the conscience of his mouth shall come out all the secrets of wisdom, for the Lord of the Spirits has given them to him and glorified him.",
        "51:4": "In those days, mountains shall dance like rams; and the hills shall leap like kids satiated with milk. And the faces of all the angels in heaven shall glow with joy, because on that day the Elect One has arisen.",
        "51:5": "And the earth shall rejoice; and the righteous ones shall dwell upon her and the elect ones shall walk upon her.",
        "52:1": "After those days, in the same place where I had seen all the secret visions, having been carried off in a wind vehicle and taken to the west, my eyes saw there all the secret things of heaven and the future things.",
        "52:2": "There were (there) a mountain of iron, a mountain of copper, a mountain of silver, a mountain of gold, a mountain of colored metal, and a mountain of lead.",
        "52:3": "And I asked the angel who was going with me, saying, “What are these things which I have seen in secret?”",
        "52:4": "And he said to me, “All these things which you have seen happen by the authority of his Messiah so that he may give orders and be praised upon the earth.”",
        "52:5": "Then this angel of peace answered, saying to me, “Wait a little, and all secret things which encircle the Lord of the Spirits will be revealed unto you.",
        "52:6": "As for these mountains which you have seen with your own eyes—the mountain of iron, the mountain of copper, the mountain of silver, the mountain of gold, the mountain of colored metal, and the mountain of lead—all of them, in the presence of the Elect One, will become like a honeycomb (that melts) before fire, like water that gushes down from the top of such mountains, and become helpless by his feet.",
        "52:7": "It shall happen in those days that no one shall be saved either by gold or by silver; and no one shall be able to escape.",
        "52:8": "There shall be no iron for war, nor shall anyone wear a breastplate. Neither bronze nor tin shall be to any avail or be of any value; and there will be no need of lead whatsoever.",
        "52:9": "All these substances will be removed and destroyed from the surface of the earth when the Elect One shall appear before the face of the Lord of the Spirits.”",
        "53:1": "My eyes saw there a deep valley with a wide mouth. And all those who dwell upon the earth, the sea, and the islands shall bring to it gifts, presents, and tributes; yet this deep valley shall not become full.",
        "53:2": "They shall fulfill the criminal deeds of their hands and eat all the produce of crime which the sinners toil for. Sinners shall be destroyed from before the face of the Lord of the Spirits—they shall perish eternally, standing before the face of his earth.",
        "53:3": "So I saw all the angels of plague co-operating and preparing all the chains of Satan.",
        "53:4": "And I asked the angel of peace, who was going with me, “For whom are they preparing these chains?”",
        "53:5": "And he answered me, saying, “They are preparing these for the kings and the potentates of this earth in order that they may be destroyed thereby.",
        "53:6": "After this, the Righteous and Elect One will reveal the house of his congregation. From that time, they shall not be hindered in the name of the Lord of the Spirits.",
        "53:7": "And these mountains shall become (flat) like earth in the presence of his righteousness, and the hills shall become like a fountain of water. And the righteous ones shall have rest from the oppression of sinners.”",
        "54:1": "Then I looked and turned to another face of the earth and saw there a valley, deep and burning with fire.",
        "54:2": "And they were bringing kings and potentates and were throwing them into this deep valley.",
        "54:3": "And my eyes saw there their chains while they were making them into iron fetters of immense weight.",
        "54:4": "And I asked the angel of peace, who was going with me, saying, “For whom are these imprisonment chains being prepared?”",
        "54:5": "And he said unto me, “These are being prepared for the armies of Azazʾel, in order that they may take them and cast them into the abyss of complete condemnation, and as the Lord of the Spirits has commanded it, they shall cover their jaws with rocky stones.",
        "54:6": "Then Michael, Raphael, Gabriel, and Phanuel themselves shall seize them on that great day of judgment and cast them into the furnace (of fire) that is burning that day, so that the Lord of the Spirits may take vengeance on them on account of their oppressive deeds which (they performed) as messengers of Satan, leading astray those who dwell upon the earth.”",
        "54:7": "And in those days, the punishment of the Lord of the Spirits shall be carried out, and they shall open all the storerooms of water in the heavens above, in addition to the fountains of water which are on earth.",
        "54:8": "And all the waters shall be united with (all) other waters. That which is from the heavens above is masculine water, (whereas) that which is underneath the earth is feminine.",
        "54:9": "And they shall obliterate all those that dwell upon the earth as well as those that dwell underneath the ultimate ends of heaven.",
        "54:10": "On account of the fact that they did not recognize their oppressive deeds which they carried out on the earth, they shall be destroyed by (the Flood).",
        "55:1": "And after that the Antecedent of Time repented and said, “In vain have I destroyed all those who dwell in the earth.”",
        "55:2": "And he swore by his own great name that from thenceforth he would not do (as he had done) to all who live upon the earth. (And he said), “I shall put up a sign in the heavens, and it shall become a (symbol) of faith between me and them forever, so long as heaven is above the earth, which is in accordance with my command.",
        "55:3": "“When I would give consent so that they should be seized by the hands of the angels on the day of tribulation and pain, already I would have caused my punishment and my wrath to abide upon them—my punishment and my wrath,” says the Lord of the Spirits.",
        "55:4": "“Kings, potentates, dwellers upon the earth: You would have to see my Elect One, how he sits in the throne of glory and judges Azazʾel and all his company, and his army, in the name of the Lord of the Spirits!”",
        "56:1": "Then I saw there an army of the angels of punishment marching, holding nets of iron and bronze.",
        "56:2": "And I asked the angel of peace, who was walking with me, saying to him, “To whom are they going, these who are holding (the nets)?”",
        "56:3": "And he said to me, “(They are going) to their elect and beloved ones in order that they may be cast into the crevices of the abyss of the valley.",
        "56:4": "Then the valley shall be filled with their elect and beloved ones; and the epoch of their lives, the era of their glory, and the age of their leading (others) astray shall come to an end and shall not henceforth be reckoned.",
        "56:5": "“In those days, the angels will assemble and thrust themselves to the east at the Parthians and Medes. They will shake up the kings (so that) a spirit of unrest shall come upon them, and stir them up from their thrones; and they will break forth from their beds like lions and like hungry hyenas among their own flocks.",
        "56:6": "And they will go up and trample upon the land of my elect ones, and the land of my elect ones will be before them like a threshing floor or a highway.",
        "56:7": "But the city of my righteous ones will become an obstacle to their horses. And they shall begin to fight among themselves; and (by) their own right hands they shall prevail against themselves. A man shall not recognize his brother, nor a son his mother, until there shall be a (significant) number of corpses from among them. Their punishment is (indeed) not in vain.",
        "56:8": "In those days, Sheol shall open her mouth, and they shall be swallowed up into it and perish. (Thus) Sheol shall swallow up the sinners in the presence of the elect ones.”",
        "57:1": "And it happened afterward that I had another vision of a whole array of chariots loaded with people; and they were advancing upon the air from the east and from the west until midday.",
        "57:2": "And the sound of their chariots (was clamorous); and when this commotion took place, the holy ones in heaven took notice of it and the pillars of the earth were shaken from their foundations; and the sound (of the noise) could be heard from the extreme end of the sky unto the extreme end of the earth in one hour.",
        "57:3": "Then all shall fall down and worship the Lord of the Spirits. Here ends the second parable.",
        "58:1": "And I began to speak another parable concerning the righteous and the elect:",
        "58:2": "Blessed are you, righteous and elect ones, for glorious is your portion.",
        "58:3": "The righteous ones shall be in the light of the sun and the elect ones in the light of eternal life which has no end, and the days of the life of the holy ones cannot be numbered.",
        "58:4": "They shall seek light and find righteousness with the Lord of the Spirits. Peace (be) to the righteous ones in the peace of the Eternal Lord!",
        "58:5": "After this, it shall be told to the holy ones in heaven that they should scrutinize the mysteries of righteousness, the gift of faith. For the sun has shined upon the earth and darkness is over.",
        "58:6": "There shall be a light that has no end, and they shall not have to count days (anymore). For already darkness has been destroyed, light shall be permanent before the Lord of the Spirits, and the light of uprightness shall stand firm forever and ever before the Lord of the Spirits.",
        "59:1": "In those days, my eyes saw the mysteries of lightnings, and of lights, and their judgments; they flash lights for a blessing or a curse, according to the will of the Lord of the Spirits.",
        "59:2": "And there I (also) saw the secrets of the thunder and the secrets of (how when) it resounds in the heights of heaven its voice is heard (in) the earthly dwellings. He showed me whether the sound of the thunder is for peace and blessing or for a curse, according to the word of the Lord of the Spirits.",
        "59:3": "After that, all the mysteries of the lights and lightnings were shown to me (that) they glow with light for blessing and for contentment.",
        "60:1": "In the year five hundred, in the seventh month, on the fourteenth day of the month in the life of Enoch; in the same parable (I saw) that the heaven of heavens was quaking and trembling with a mighty tremulous agitation, and the forces of the Most High and the angels, ten thousand times a million and ten million times ten million, were agitated with great agitation.",
        "60:2": "And the Antecedent of Time was sitting on the throne of his glory surrounded by the angels and the righteous ones.",
        "60:3": "(Then) a great trembling and fear seized me and my loins and kidneys lost control. So I fell upon my face.",
        "60:4": "Then Michael sent another angel from among the holy ones and he raised me up. And when he had raised me up, my spirit returned; for (I had fainted) because I could not withstand the sight of these forces and (because) heaven has stirred up and agitated itself.",
        "60:5": "Then Michael said unto me, “What have you seen that has so disturbed you? This day of mercy has lasted until today; and he has been merciful and long-suffering toward those that dwell upon the earth.",
        "60:6": "And when this day arrives—and the power, the punishment, and the judgment, which the Lord of the Spirits has prepared for those who do not worship the righteous judgment, for those who deny the righteous judgment, and for those who take his name in vain—it will become a day of covenant for the elect and inquisition for the sinners.”",
        "60:7": "On that day, two monsters will be parted—one monster, a female named Leviathan, in order to dwell in the abyss of the ocean over the fountains of water;",
        "60:8": "and (the other), a male called Behemoth, which holds his chest in an invisible desert whose name is Dundayin, east of the garden of Eden, wherein the elect and the righteous ones dwell, wherein my grandfather was taken, the seventh from Adam, the first man whom the Lord of the Spirits created.",
        "60:9": "Then I asked the second angel in order that he may show me (how) strong these monsters are, how they were separated on this day and were cast, the one into the abysses of the ocean, and the other into the dry desert.",
        "60:10": "And he said to me, “You, son of man, according (to the degree) to which it will be permitted, you will know the hidden things.”",
        "60:11": "Then the other angel who was going with me was showing me the hidden things: what is first and last in heaven, above it, beneath the earth, in the depth, in the extreme ends of heaven, the extent of heaven;",
        "60:12": "the storerooms of the winds, how the winds are divided, how they are weighed, how the winds divide and dissipate, the openings of the winds, each according to the strength of its wind; the power of the light of the moon and how it is the right amount, the divisions of the stars, each according to its nomenclature, and all the subdivisions;",
        "60:13": "the thunders according to the places where they fall, and the subdivisions of the lightnings according to their flashing of light and the velocity of the obedience of the whole array of them.",
        "60:14": "So the thunders have their (respective) moments of rest with patience; and (each thunder) is marked by its (respective) sound. Neither the thunder nor the lightning becomes disjoined one from the other; both go together in a single breeze and do not part.",
        "60:15": "For when the lightning flashes light, the thunder utters its sound; also, at that moment, the wind causes (the thunder) to come to rest and divides equally (the time) between each one of them. For the reservoir of their moments (of thunderings) is like the sand, (so) each one of them is restrained with a bridle and turned back by the power of the wind and driven in this manner all over the numerous comers of the earth.",
        "60:16": "Now, the sea breeze is masculine and strong and according to the power of its strength it holds back (the air) and, in this manner, is driven and dispersed among all the mountains of the world.",
        "60:17": "The frost-wind is its own guardian and the hail-wind is a kind messenger.",
        "60:18": "The snow-wind has evacuated (its reservoir); it does not exist because of its strength; there is in it only a breeze that ascends from (the reservoir) like smoke, and its name is frost.",
        "60:19": "And the wind and the mist do not dwell together with them in their reservoirs. But (the mist) has its own reservoir, for its course is glorious. It has light and darkness both in the rainy season and the dry season; and its reservoir is itself an angel.",
        "60:20": "The dwelling place of the dew-breeze is in the extreme ends of heaven and is linked together with the reservoirs of the rain in (both) its courses of the rainy season and the dry season; also the clouds of (the dew) and the clouds of the mist are associated feeding each other mutually.",
        "60:21": "When the rain-wind becomes activated in its reservoir, the angels come and open the reservoir and let it out; and when it is sprayed over the whole earth, it becomes united with the water which is upon the earth;",
        "60:22": "and whensoever it unites with (other waters, it unites) with the water upon the earth which is for the use of those who dwell on the earth, for it is nourishment for the earth (sent) from the Most High in heaven. So in this manner there is a measuring system for the rain given to the angels.",
        "60:23": "All these things I saw as far as the garden of the righteous ones.",
        "60:24": "And the angel of peace who was with me said to me, “These two monsters are prepared for the great day of the Lord (when) they shall turn into food.",
        "60:25": "So that the punishment of the Lord of the Spirits should come down upon them in order that the punishment of the Lord of the Spirits should not be issued in vain but slay the children with their mothers, and the children with their fathers, when the punishment of the Lord of the Spirits comes down upon everyone. After that there shall be the judgment according to his mercy and his patience.”",
        "61:1": "I saw in those days that long ropes were given to those angels; and hoisting up their own (respective) portions (of the ropes), they soared going in the direction of the northeast.",
        "61:2": "And I asked the angel, saying unto him, “Why have those (angels) hoisted these ropes and gone off?” And he said unto me, “They have gone in order to make measurements.”",
        "61:3": "The angel who was going with me also said unto me, “These (angels) are the ones who shall bring the measuring ropes of the righteous ones as well as their binding cords in order that they might lean upon the name of the Lord of the Spirits forever and ever. Then the elect ones shall begin to walk with the elect ones.",
        "61:4": "These are the measurements which shall be given to faith and which shall strengthen righteousness.",
        "61:5": "And these measurements shall reveal all the secrets of the depths of the earth, those who have been destroyed in the desert, those who have been devoured by the wild beasts, and those who have been eaten by the fish of the sea. So that they all return and find hope in the day of the Elect One. For there is no one who perishes before the Lord of the Spirits, and no one who should perish.",
        "61:6": "And those who are in heaven above and all the powers received a command—one voice and one light like fire.",
        "61:7": "And him, the First Word, they shall bless, extol, and glorify with wisdom. They shall be wise in utterance in the spirit of life and in the Lord of the Spirits.",
        "61:8": "He placed the Elect One on the throne of glory; and he shall judge all the works of the holy ones in heaven above, weighing in the balance their deeds.",
        "61:9": "And when he shall lift up his countenance in order to judge the secret ways of theirs, by the word of the name of the Lord of the Spirits, and their conduct, by the method of the righteous judgment of the Lord of the Spirits, then they shall all speak with one voice, blessing, glorifying, extolling, sanctifying the name of the Lord of the Spirits.",
        "61:10": "And he will summon all the forces of the heavens, and all the holy ones above, and the forces of the Lord—the cherubim, seraphim, ophanim, all the angels of governance, the Elect One, and the other forces on earth (and) over the water.",
        "61:11": "On that day, they shall lift up in one voice, blessing, glorifying, and extolling in the spirit of faith, in the spirit of wisdom and patience, in the spirit of mercy, in the spirit of justice and peace, and in the spirit of generosity. They shall all say in one voice, ‘Blessed (is he) and may the name of the Lord of the Spirits be blessed forever and evermore.’",
        "61:12": "All the vigilant ones in heaven above shall bless him; all the holy ones who are in heaven shall bless him; all the elect ones who dwell in the garden of life (shall bless him); every spirit of light that is capable of blessing, glorifying, extolling, and sanctifying your blessed name (shall bless him); and all flesh shall glorify and bless your name with an exceedingly limitless power forever and ever.",
        "61:13": "For the mercy of the Lord of the Spirits is great in quantity, and he is long-suffering. All his works and all the dimensions of his creation, he has revealed to the righteous and the elect ones in the name of the Lord of the Spirits.”",
        "62:1": "Thus the Lord commanded the kings, the governors, the high officials, and the landlords and said, “Open your eyes and lift up your eyebrows—if you are able to recognize the Elect One!”",
        "62:2": "The Lord of the Spirits has sat down on the throne of his glory, and the spirit of righteousness has been poured out upon him. The word of his mouth will do the sinners in; and all the oppressors shall be eliminated from before his face.",
        "62:3": "On the day of judgment, all the kings, the governors, the high officials, and the landlords shall see and recognize him—how he sits on the throne of his glory, and righteousness is judged before him, and that no nonsensical talk shall be uttered in his presence.",
        "62:4": "Then pain shall come upon them as on a woman in travail with birth pangs—when she is giving birth (the child) enters the mouth of the womb and she suffers from childbearing.",
        "62:5": "One half portion of them shall glance at the other half; they shall be terrified and dejected; and pain shall seize them when they see that Son of Man sitting on the throne of his glory.",
        "62:6": "(These) kings, governors, and all the landlords shall (try to) bless, glorify, extol him who rules over everything, him who has been concealed.",
        "62:7": "For the Son of Man was concealed from the beginning, and the Most High One preserved him in the presence of his power; then he revealed him to the holy and the elect ones.",
        "62:8": "The congregation of the holy ones shall be planted, and all the elect ones shall stand before him.",
        "62:9": "On that day, all the kings, the governors, the high officials, and those who rule the earth shall fall down before him on their faces, and worship and raise their hopes in that Son of Man; they shall beg and plead for mercy at his feet.",
        "62:10": "But the Lord of the Spirits himself will cause them to be frantic, so that they shall rush and depart from his presence. Their faces shall be filled with shame, and their countenances shall be crowned with darkness.",
        "62:11": "So he will deliver them to the angels for punishments in order that vengeance shall be executed on them—oppressors of his children and his elect ones.",
        "62:12": "It shall become quite a scene for my righteous and elect ones. They shall rejoice over (the kings, the governors, the high officials, and the landlords) because the wrath of the Lord of the Spirits shall rest upon them and his sword (shall obtain) from them a sacrifice.",
        "62:13": "The righteous and elect ones shall be saved on that day; and from thenceforth they shall never see the faces of the sinners and the oppressors.",
        "62:14": "The Lord of the Spirits will abide over them; they shall eat and rest and rise with that Son of Man forever and ever.",
        "62:15": "The righteous and elect ones shall rise from the earth and shall cease being of downcast face. They shall wear the garments of glory.",
        "62:16": "These garments of yours shall become the garments of life from the Lord of the Spirits. Neither shall your garments wear out, nor your glory come to an end before the Lord of the Spirits.",
        "63:1": "In those days, the governors and the kings who possess the land shall plead that he may give them a little breathing spell from the angels of his punishment to whom they have been delivered; so that they shall fall and worship before the Lord of the Spirits, and confess their sins before him.",
        "63:2": "They shall bless and glorify the Lord of the Spirits and say, “Blessed is the Lord of the Spirits—the Lord of kings, the Lord of rulers, and the Master of the rich—the Lord of glory and the Lord of wisdom.",
        "63:3": "Your power exposes every secret thing from generation to generation and your glory is forever and ever. Deep are all your mysteries—and numberless; and your righteousness is beyond accounting.",
        "63:4": "Now we have come to know that we should glorify and bless the Lord of kings—him who rules over all kings.”",
        "63:5": "Moreover, they shall say, “Would that someone had given us a chance so that we should glorify, praise, and have faith before his glory!",
        "63:6": "This time, however, we are begging for a little rest but find it not; we pursue (it), but procure it not. Light has vanished from before us and darkness has become our habitation forever and ever;",
        "63:7": "because we have formerly neither had faith nor glorified the name of the Lord of the Spirits and kings, nor glorified the Lord in all his creation. We had put our hopes upon the scepters of our empires.",
        "63:8": "(Now) on the day of our hardship and our tribulation he is not saving us; and we have no chance to become believers. For our Lord is faithful in all his works, his judgments, and his righteousness; and his judgments have no respect of persons.",
        "63:9": "(So) we will vanish away from before his face on account of our deeds; and all our sins are consumed by righteousness.”",
        "63:10": "Furthermore, at that time, you shall say, “Our souls are satiated with exploitation money which could not save us from being cast into the oppressive Sheol.”",
        "63:11": "After that, their faces shall be filled with shame before that Son of Man; and from before his face they shall be driven out. And the sword shall abide in their midst, before his face.",
        "63:12": "Thus says the Lord of the Spirits, “This is the ordinance and the judgment, before the Lord of the Spirits, (prepared) for the governors, kings, high officials, and landlords.”",
        "64:1": "Then I saw in that place other mysterious faces.",
        "64:2": "And I heard the voice of an angel saying, “These are the angels who descended upon the earth and revealed what was hidden to the children of the people, and led the children of the people astray to commit sin.”",
        "65:1": "In those days, Noah saw the earth, that she had become deformed, and that her destruction was at hand.",
        "65:2": "And (Noah) took off from there and went unto the extreme ends of the earth. And he cried out to his grandfather, Enoch, and said to him, three times, with a bitter voice, “Hear me! Hear me! Hear me!”",
        "65:3": "And I said unto him, “Tell me what this thing is which is being done upon the earth, for the earth is struggling in this manner and is being shaken; perhaps I will perish with her in the impact.”",
        "65:4": "At that moment, there took place a tremendous turbulence upon the earth; and a voice from heaven was heard, and I fell upon my face.",
        "65:5": "Then Enoch, my grandfather, came and stood by me, saying to me, “Why did you cry out so sorrowfully and with bitter tears?",
        "65:6": "“An order has been issued from the court of the Lord against those who dwell upon the earth, that their doom has arrived because they have acquired the knowledge of all the secrets of the angels, all the oppressive deeds of the Satans, as well as all their most occult powers, all the powers of those who practice sorcery, all the powers of (those who mix) many colors, all the powers of those who make molten images;",
        "65:7": "how silver is produced from the dust of the earth, and how bronze is made upon the earth—",
        "65:8": "for lead and tin are produced from the earth like silver—their source is a fountain inside (which) stands an angel, and he is a running angel.”",
        "65:9": "After that, my grandfather, Enoch, took hold of me by my hand and raised me up and said to me, “Go, for I have asked the Lord of the Spirits regarding this turbulence (which is taking place) on the earth.”",
        "65:10": "He (continued to) say to me, “Because their oppression has been carried out (on the earth), their judgment will be limitless before me. On account of the abstract things which they have investigated and experienced, the earth shall perish (together with) those who dwell upon her.",
        "65:11": "And those (who taught them these things) will have no haven forever, because they have revealed to them the things which are secret—to the condemned ones; but, as for you, my son, the Lord of the Spirits knows that you are pure and kindhearted; you detest the secret things.",
        "65:12": "He has preserved your name for the holy ones; he will protect you from those who dwell upon the earth; he has preserved your righteous seed for kingship and great glory; and from your seed will emerge a fountain of the righteous and holy ones without number forever.”",
        "66:1": "After this he showed me the angels of punishment who are prepared to come and release all the powers of the waters which are underground to become judgment and destruction unto all who live and dwell upon the earth.",
        "66:2": "But the Lord of the Spirits gave an order to the angels who were on duty that they should not raise the (water) enclosures but guard (them)—for they were the angels who were in charge of the waters. Then I left from the presence of Enoch.",
        "67:1": "In those days, the word of God came unto me, and said unto me, “Noah, your lot has come up before me—a lot without blame, a lot of true love.",
        "67:2": "At this time the angels are working with wood (making an ark) and when it is completed, I shall place my hands upon it and protect it, and the seed of life shall arise from it; and a substitute (generation) will come so that the earth will not remain empty (without inhabitants).",
        "67:3": "I shall strengthen your seed before me forever and ever as well as the seeds of those who dwell with you; I shall not put it to trial on the face of the earth; but it shall be blessed and multiply on the earth in the name of the Lord.”",
        "67:4": "And they shall imprison those angels who revealed oppression in that burning valley which my grandfather Enoch had formerly shown me in the West among the mountains of gold, silver, iron, bronze, and tin.",
        "67:5": "I also saw that valley in which there took place a great turbulence and the stirring of the waters.",
        "67:6": "Now, when all this took place, there was produced from that bronze and fire a smell of sulfur (which) blended with those waters.",
        "67:7": "This valley of the perversive angels shall (continue to) burn punitively underneath that ground; in respect to its troughs, they shall be filled with rivers of water by which those angels who perverted those who dwell upon the earth shall be punished.",
        "67:8": "Those waters shall become in those days a poisonous drug of the body and a punishment of the spirit unto the kings, rulers, and exalted ones, and those who dwell on the earth; lust shall fill their souls so that their bodies shall be punished, for they have denied the Lord of the Spirits; they shall see their own punishment every day but cannot believe in his name.",
        "67:9": "In proportion to the great degree of the burning of their bodies will be the transmutation of their spirits forever and ever and ever, for there is none that can speak a nonsensical word before the Lord of the Spirits.",
        "67:10": "So the judgment shall come upon them, because they believe in the debauchery of their bodies and deny the spirit of the Lord.",
        "67:11": "And these waters will undergo change in those days; for (on the one hand) when those angels are being punished by these waters, the temperatures of those fountains of water will be altered (and become hot), but (on the other hand) when the angels get out, those waters of the fountains shall be transformed and become cold.",
        "67:12": "Then I heard Michael responding and saying, “This verdict by which the angels are being punished is itself a testimony to the kings and the rulers who control the world.”",
        "67:13": "For these waters of judgment are poison to the bodies of the angels as well as sensational to their flesh; (hence) they will neither see nor believe that these waters become transformed and become a fire that burns forever.",
        "68:1": "After that, he gave me instructions in all the secret things (found) in the book of my grandfather, Enoch, and in the parables which were given to him; and he put them together for me in the words of the book which is with me.",
        "68:2": "On that day, Michael addressed himself to Raphael, saying to him, “The power of the spirit grabs me and causes me to go up on account of the severity of the judgment concerning (the knowledge of) the secrets. Who is able to endure the severity of the judgment which has been executed and before which one melts away?”",
        "68:3": "Michael continued to speak further, saying to Raphael, “Who is he whose heart does not become sordid in respect to this matter and whose reins do not become stirred up from the word of the judgment which has been pronounced against them.”",
        "68:4": "Then it happened that when they stood before the Lord of the Spirits, Michael said to Raphael thus, “They shall not prosper before the eye of the Lord; for they have quarreled with the Lord of the Spirits because they make the image of the Lord.",
        "68:5": "Therefore, all that which has been concealed shall come upon them forever and ever; for neither an angel nor a man should be assigned his role; (so) those (evil ones) alone have received their judgment forever and ever.”",
        "69:1": "After this judgment, they shall frighten them and make them scream because they have shown this (knowledge of secret things) to those who dwell on the earth.",
        "69:2": "Now behold, I am naming the names of those angels! These are their names: The first of them is Semyaz, the second Aristaqis, the third Armen, the fourth Kokbaʾel, the fifth Turʾel, the sixth Rumyal, the seventh Danyul, the eighth Neqaʾel, the ninth Baraqel, the tenth Azazʾel, the eleventh Armaros, the twelfth Betryal, the thirteenth Basasʾel, the fourteenth Hananʾel, the fifteenth Turʾel, the sixteenth Sipweseʾel, (the seventeenth Yeterʾel), the eighteenth Tumaʾel, the nineteenth Turʾel, the twentieth Rumʾel, and the twenty-first Azazʾel.",
        "69:3": "These are the chiefs of their angels, their names, their centurions, their chiefs over fifties, and their chiefs over tens.",
        "69:4": "The name of the first is Yeqon; he is the one who misled all the children of the angels, brought them down upon the earth, and perverted them by the daughters of the people.",
        "69:5": "The second was named Asbʾel; he is the one who gave the children of the holy angels an evil counsel and misled them so that they would defile their bodies by the daughters of the people.",
        "69:6": "The third was named Gaderʾel; this one is he who showed the children of the people all the blows of death, who misled Eve, who showed the children of the people (how to make) the instruments of death (such as) the shield, the breastplate, and the sword for warfare, and all (the other) instruments of death to the children of the people.",
        "69:7": "Through their agency (death) proceeds against the people who dwell upon the earth, from that day forevermore.",
        "69:8": "The fourth is named Pinemʾe; this one demonstrated to the children of the people the bitter and the sweet and revealed to them all the secrets of their wisdom.",
        "69:9": "Furthermore he caused the people to penetrate (the secret of) writing and (the use of) ink and paper; on account of this matter, there are many who have erred from eternity to eternity, until this very day.",
        "69:10": "For human beings are not created for such purposes to take up their beliefs with pen and ink.",
        "69:11": "For indeed human beings were not created but to be like angels, permanently to maintain pure and righteous lives. Death, which destroys everything, would have not touched them, had it not been through their knowledge by which they shall perish; death is (now) eating us by means of this power.",
        "69:12": "The fifth is named Kasadya; it is he who revealed to the children of the people (the various) flagellations of all evil—(the flagellation) of the souls and the demons, the smashing of the embryo in the womb so that it may be crushed, the flagellation of the soul, snake bites, sunstrokes, the son of the serpent, whose name is Tabaʿta.",
        "69:13": "And this is the number of Kasbʾel, the chief (executor) of the oath which he revealed to the holy ones while he was (still) dwelling in the highest in glory.",
        "69:14": "His name was (then) Beqa; and he spoke to Michael to disclose to him his secret name so that he would memorize this secret name of his, so that he would call it up in an oath in order that they shall tremble before it and the oath.",
        "69:15": "He (then) revealed these to the children of the people, (and) all the hidden things and this power of this oath, for it is power and strength itself. The Evil One placed this oath in Michael’s hand.",
        "69:16": "These are the secrets of this oath—and they are sustained by the oath: The heaven was suspended before the creation of the world; and forever!",
        "69:17": "By it the earth is founded upon the water; from the hidden places of the mountains come beautiful waters, from the beginning of creation; and forever!",
        "69:18": "By that oath, the sea was created; and he put down for it a foundation of sand which cannot be transgressed at a time of its anger, from the beginning of creation; and forever!",
        "69:19": "And by that oath the depths are made firm; they stand still and do not move from their places from the beginning (of creation); and forever!",
        "69:20": "By the same oath the sun and the moon complete their courses of travel, and do not deviate from the laws (made) for them, from the beginning (of creation); and forever!",
        "69:21": "And by the same oath the stars complete their courses of travel; if they call their names, he causes them to respond from the beginning (of creation); and forever!",
        "69:22": "Likewise the waters and their souls, all the winds and their paths of travel from all the directions of winds;",
        "69:23": "the voice of the thunder and the light of the lightning are kept there;",
        "69:24": "the reservoirs of hail, the reservoirs of frost, the reservoirs of mist, the reservoirs of rain and dew are kept there;",
        "69:25": "All these believe and give thanks in the presence of the Lord of the Spirits; they glorify with all their might, and please him in all this thanksgiving; they shall thank, glorify, exalt the Lord of the Spirits forever and ever!",
        "69:26": "This oath has become dominant over them; they are preserved by it and their paths are preserved by it (so that) their courses of travel do not perish.",
        "69:27": "(Then) there came to them a great joy. And they blessed, glorified, and extolled (the Lord) on account of the fact that the name of that (Son of) Man was revealed to them.  He shall never pass away or perish from before the face of the earth.",
        "69:28": "But those who have led the world astray shall be bound with chains; and their ruinous congregation shall be imprisoned; all their deeds shall vanish from before the face of the earth.",
        "69:29": "Thenceforth nothing that is corruptible shall be found; for that Son of Man has appeared and has seated himself upon the throne of his glory; and all evil shall disappear from before his face; he shall go and tell to that Son of Man, and he shall be strong before the Lord of the Spirits. Here ends the third parable of Enoch.",
        "70:1": "And it happened after this that his living name was raised up before that Son of Man and to the Lord from among those who dwell upon the earth;",
        "70:2": "it was lifted up in a wind chariot and it disappeared from among them.",
        "70:3": "From that day on, I was not counted among them. But he placed me between two winds, between the northeast and the west, where the angels took a cord to measure for me the place for the elect and righteous ones.",
        "70:4": "And there I saw the first (human) ancestors and the righteous ones of old, dwelling in that place.",
        "71:1": "(Thus) it happened after this that my spirit passed out of sight and ascended into the heavens. And I saw the sons of the holy angels walking upon the flame of fire; their garments were white—and their overcoats—and the light of their faces was like snow.",
        "71:2": "Also I saw two rivers of fire, the light of which fire was shining like hyacinth. Then I fell upon my face before the Lord of the Spirits.",
        "71:3": "And the angel Michael, one of the archangels, seizing me by my right hand and lifting me up, led me out into all the secrets of mercy; and he showed me all the secrets of righteousness.",
        "71:4": "He also showed me all the secrets of the extreme ends of heaven and all the reservoirs of the stars and the luminaries—from where they come out (to shine) before the faces of the holy ones.",
        "71:5": "He carried off my spirit, and I, Enoch, was in the heaven of heavens. There I saw—in the midst of that light—a structure built of crystals; and between those crystals tongues of living fire.",
        "71:6": "And my spirit saw a ring which encircled this structure of fire. On its four sides were rivers full of living fire which encircled it.",
        "71:7": "Moreover, seraphim, cherubim, and ophanim—the sleepless ones who guard the throne of his glory—also encircled it.",
        "71:8": "And I saw countless angels—a hundred thousand times a hundred thousand, ten million times ten million—encircling that house. Michael, Raphael, Gabriel, Phanuel, and numerous (other) holy angels that are in heaven above, go in and out of that house—",
        "71:9": "Michael, Raphael, Gabriel, Phanuel, and numerous (other) holy angels that are countless.",
        "71:10": "With them is the Antecedent of Time: His head is white and pure like wool and his garment is indescribable.",
        "71:11": "I fell on my face, my whole body mollified and my spirit transformed. Then I cried with a great voice by the spirit of the power, blessing, glorifying, and extolling.",
        "71:12": "And those are the blessings which went forth out of my mouth, being well-pleasing in the presence of that Antecedent of Time.",
        "71:13": "Then the Antecedent of Time came with Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, Phanuel, and a hundred thousand and ten million times a hundred thousand angels that are countless.",
        "71:14": "Then an angel came to me and greeted me and said to me, “You, son of man, who art born in righteousness and upon whom righteousness has dwelt, the righteousness of the Antecedent of Time will not forsake you.”",
        "71:15": "He added and said to me, “He shall proclaim peace to you in the name of the world that is to become. For from here proceeds peace since the creation of the world, and so it shall be unto you forever and ever and ever.",
        "71:16": "Everyone that will come to exist and walk shall (follow)v your path, since righteousness never forsakes you. Together with you shall be their dwelling places; and together with you shall be their portion. They shall not be separated from you forever and ever and ever.”",
        "71:17": "So there shall be length of days with that Son of Man, and peace to the righteous ones; his path is upright for the righteous, in the name of the Lord of the Spirits forever and ever.",
        "72:1": "The Book of the Itinerary of the Luminaries of Heaven: the position of each and every one, in respect to their ranks, in respect to their authorities, and in respect to their seasons; each one according to their names and their places of origin and according to their months, which Uriel, the holy angel who was with me, and who (also) is their guide, showed me—just as he showed me all their treatises and the nature of the years of the world unto eternity, till the new creation which abides forever is created.",
        "72:2": "This is the first commandment of the luminaries: The sun is a luminary whose egress is an opening of heaven, which is (located) in the direction of the east, and whose ingress is (another) opening of heaven, (located) in the west.",
        "72:3": "I saw six openings through which the sun rises and six openings through which it sets. The moon also rises and sets through the same openings, and they are guided by the stars; together with those whom they lead, they are six in the east and six in the west heaven. All of them (are arranged) one after another in a constant order. There are many windows (both) to the left and the right of these openings.",
        "72:4": "First there goes out the great light whose name is the sun; its roundness is like the roundness of the sky; and it is totally filled with light and heat.",
        "72:5": "The chariot on which it ascends is (driven by) the blowing wind. The sun sets in the sky (in the west) and returns by the northeast in order to go to the east; it is guided so that it shall reach the eastern gate and shine in the face of the sky.",
        "72:6": "In this manner it rises in the first month through the major gate; it proceeds (through this gate) which is the fourth (among) those six openings which are (located) in the direction of the east.",
        "72:7": "By this fourth gate through which the sun rises during the first month there are twelve open windows from which a flame flows, when they are opened at the appropriate time.",
        "72:8": "When (the sun) rises (in the east) in the sky, it goes out through this fourth gate for thirty mornings and descends faithfully through the fourth gate in the western sky.",
        "72:9": "During those (thirty) days the day daily becomes longer and the night nightly shorter, for thirty days.",
        "72:10": "On that day, the day is longer than the night by one ninth; so the day turns out to be exactly ten parts and the night to be eight parts.",
        "72:11": "The sun rises from that fourth (eastern) gate and sets in the fourth (western) one, and then it turns and comes into the fifth gate of the east for thirty days, through which it rises, and sets in the fifth gate.",
        "72:12": "At that time the day further becomes longer and becomes eleven parts and the night shortens and becomes seven parts on account of the sun.",
        "72:13": "It then returns to the east and comes into the sixth (gate), rising and setting through that sixth gate for thirty-one days, according to the principle of (the gate).",
        "72:14": "On that day the day becomes longer than the night still further; so the day becomes twelve parts and the night shortens and becomes six is parts.",
        "72:15": "Then the sun is raised in such a way that (its duration) shortens and night occurs; the sun returns to the east and enters the sixth gate, rising and setting through it for thirty days.",
        "72:16": "When thirty days are completed, the day decreases exactly by one part, and becomes eleven parts, and the night seven.",
        "72:17": "Then the sun, leaving the west by that sixth gate and going to the east, rises through the fifth gate for thirty mornings and sets again in the fifth gate in the west.",
        "72:18": "On that day the day decreases by two parts; so (the day) becomes ten parts and the night eight parts.",
        "72:19": "Then the sun, departing from that fifth gate and setting in the fifth gate, in the west, rises in the fourth gate for thirty-one days according to the principle of (the gate), and sets in the west.",
        "72:20": "On that day the day is aligned with the night, so that they become equal; so the night becomes nine parts and the day nine parts.",
        "72:21": "Then the sun, departing from that gate and setting in the west, returns to the east and comes out through the third gate for thirty days, and sets in the third gate in the west.",
        "72:22": "On that day the night becomes longer than the day; it becomes longer than the (previous) night and the day becomes shorter than the (previous) day for thirty day; so the night turns out to be exactly ten parts and the day to be eight parts.",
        "72:23": "Then the sun, departing from that third gate in the west and returning to the east, comes out through the second gate in the east for thirty days, and in the same manner it sets through the second gate in the western sky.",
        "72:24": "On that day the night becomes eleven parts and the day seven parts.",
        "72:25": "Then the sun, departing on that day from that second gate and setting in the west in the second gate, returns to the east and rises in the first gate for thirty-one days, and sets on that day in the western sky.",
        "72:26": "On that day the night lengthens and becomes twelve parts, whereas the day (shortens and becomes) six parts.",
        "72:27": "Thus the sun completes its appearances, and goes through those same cycles of appearances a second time, coming out through all the openings for thirty days and setting also in the west opposite to it.",
        "72:28": "On that night the length of the night decreases by one ninth; so the night becomes eleven parts and the day seven parts.",
        "72:29": "Then the sun, returning and entering the second gate which is in the east, resumes its appearances for thirty mornings, rising and setting (as usual).",
        "72:30": "On that day the night becomes shorter, so the night becomes ten parts and the day eight parts.",
        "72:31": "On that day the sun, departing from this second gate and setting in the west, returns to the east and rises through the third gate for thirty-one days, and sets in the western sky.",
        "72:32": "On that day the night shortens and becomes nine parts and the day nine parts. Then the night becomes equal with the day, and the days (of the year) add up to exactly three hundred sixty-four days.",
        "72:33": "The lengths of the day and the night as well as the shortnesses of the day and the night are (determined) by (the course of) the circuit of the sun, and distinguished by it.",
        "72:34": "The circuit becomes longer or shorter day by day and night by night (respectively).",
        "72:35": "Thus this is the order for the course of the movement and the settlement of the sun—that great luminary which is called the sun, for the duration of the year(s) of the universe—in respect to its going in and coming out.",
        "72:36": "It is that very (luminary) which manifests itself in its appearance as God has commanded that it shall come out and go in, in this manner.",
        "72:37": "And neither does it diminish (in respect to its brightness) not take rest but continue to run day and night. As for the intensity of its light, it is sevenfold brighter than that of the moon; nevertheless, (the sun and the moon) are equal in regard to their (respective) sizes.",
        "73:1": "After I saw this (set of) regulation(s for the sun) I saw another (set of) regulation(s)a concerning the minor luminary whose name is moon.",
        "73:2": "Its roundness is like the roundness of the sky, and the wind drives the chariot on which it rides; and it is given light in (varying) measure.",
        "73:3": "Its coming out and its going in change every month. Its days are like the days of the sun; and when its light becomes evenly (distributed) then it amounts to one seventh of the light of the sun.",
        "73:4": "It (the moon) rises in this manner: Its head faces the easterly direction, coming out on the thirtieth day, on that day, (that is,) on the thirtieth day, it comes into existence, and it appears with the sun in the gate through which the sun exits; and you have the beginning of the month.",
        "73:5": "(Considering) half of it to be (divisible into) seven parts, the whole disk of it is without light, with the exception of one-seventh part of the fourteenth part of the light (of the sun), one seventh of its (half) light.",
        "73:6": "On the day when it receives one-seventh part of its one half, as the sun sets, it becomes (equivalent to) one-seventh light of one half of it.",
        "73:7": "Then when the sun rises, the moon rises together with it, taking a portion of one half of its light; that night (the moon), just beginning its monthly journey on its first lunar day, sets with the sun and becomes dark, in respect to its thirteen parts that night. On that day it rises and shines with exactly one-seventh part (of its semicircle).",
        "73:8": "Then it comes out and recedes toward the east (away from) where the sun rises, (continuing) to be bright(er) in one sixth of one seventh (of one half of the light of the sun) during the remaining days.",
        "74:1": "Furthermore, I saw another system of rotation with its own regulation whereby the system fulfills its monthly course of movement.",
        "74:2": "All these things—including their fixed positions—Uriel, the holy angel who is the guide of all of them, showed to me. And I wrote down their fixed positions as he showed them to me; and I wrote down their months as they were, as well as the (variable) aspects of their illumination until the completion of fifteen days.",
        "74:3": "The moon wanes in fifteen steps during a period of fifteen days, and waxes in fourteen steps in the east and the west respectively.",
        "74:4": "In (certain) designated months it alters its (westerly) settings and in (certain) designated months it fulfills its unusual courses of movement.",
        "74:5": "For two months it (the moon) sets with the sun, and uses those two middle openings (which are) the third and the fourth gate.",
        "74:6": "It comes out for seven days and completes a circuit as it returns again to the gate through which the sun rises. In this manner it waxes and recedes from the sun, entering the sixth gate through which the sun rises in eight days.",
        "74:7": "When the sun rises through the fourth gate (the moon) comes out for seven days, until it starts coming out through the fifth. It then turns back toward the fourth gate in seven days, waxing as it recedes, and enters the first gate in eight days.",
        "74:8": "Then again it returns to the fourth gate through which the sun rises in seven days.",
        "74:9": "This is how I saw their fixed positions—how the moon rises and shines when the sun sets—in those days.",
        "74:10": "If five years are combined the sun gains thirty extra days; consequently one of those five years gains, and when it is completed, it turns out to be three hundred sixty-four days.",
        "74:11": "The gain of the sun and of the stars turns out to be six days; in five years, six days every year add up to thirty days; and the moon falls behind the sun and the stars for thirty days.",
        "74:12": "They bring about all the years punctiliously, so that they forever neither gain upon nor fall behind their fixed positions for a single day, but they convert the year with punctilious justice into three hundred sixty-four days.",
        "74:13": "In three (years) there are one thousand ninety-two days and in five years one thousand eight hundred and twenty days, so that in eight years there are two thousand nine hundred and twelve days.",
        "74:14": "For the moon singly in three (years) its days add up to one thousand thirty is days, so that it falls behind by sixty-two days in three years.",
        "74:15": "In five years (they add up to) one thousand eight hundred seventy days, so that it falls behind by fifty days in five years. Thus it is for the moon.",
        "74:16": "In eight years the days (add up to) two thousand eight hundred thirty-two days, so that it falls behind by eight days in eight years.",
        "74:17": "(In this way) the years are completed with precision, in accordance with their fixed positions in the universe and the fixed stations of the sun which shine, the gate through which it (the sun) rises and sets for thirty days.",
        "75:1": "The leaders of the chiefs of the thousands, which are appointed over the whole creation and upon all the stars, are counted together with the four (leaders of the seasons); they do not leave from the fixed stations according to the reckoning of the year; and they render service on the four days which are not counted in the reckoning of the year.",
        "75:2": "On this account, people err in them, for those luminaries scrupulously render service to the fixed positions in the cosmos—one in the first gate of heaven, one in the third, one in the fourth, one in the fifth, and one in the sixth. In this manner the year is completed scrupulously in three hundred sixty-four fixed stations of the cosmos.",
        "75:3": "Thus the signs, the durations of time, the years, and the days were shown to me (by) the angel Uriel, whom the Lord, God of eternal glory, has appointed over all the luminaries of heaven—(both) in heaven and the world—in order that they—the sun, the moon, the stars, and all the created objects which circulate in all the chariots of heaven—should rule in the face of the sky and be seen on the earth to be guides for the day and the night.",
        "75:4": "Likewise Uriel showed me twelve wide openings in the sky, along the course of the chariots of the sun, from which the rays of the sun break out and from which heat is diffused upon the earth, when they are opened during the designated seasons.",
        "75:5": "Their openings (affect) the winds and the spirit of the dew,",
        "75:6": "(that is) when the twelve wide openings are opened in the sky, in the extreme ends of the earth, through which (also) the sun, the moon, the stars, and all the (other) heavenly objects come out in the west.",
        "75:7": "There are many open windows to the left and the right, but one window produces the heat at its designated time in the manner of those openings through which the stars rise in accordance with their orders and set according to their numbers.",
        "75:8": "I also saw chariots in heaven running in the universe above those openings in which the stars that do not set revolve.",
        "75:9": "One (circuit) is larger than the rest of them all, and it circles the entire cosmos at the extreme ends of the earth.",
        "76:1": "And I saw the twelve wide openings in all the directions through which the winds come out and blow over the earth.",
        "76:2": "Three of them are open in the forefront of the sky, three in the west, three in the right of the sky, and three on the left;",
        "76:3": "(in other words) the first three are those on the morning side (followed by) three in the direction of the north; the last three are those on the left, in the direction of the south (followed by) three in the west.",
        "76:4": "Through four of the (openings)g blow out winds of blessing (and) through eight of them blow out winds of pestilence—when they are sent in order to destroy the whole earth, the water upon her, all those who dwell upon her, and all those which exist in the waters and the dry land.",
        "76:5": "The first (group of) winds goes out from those openings called the easterly. Out of the first gate, which is in the direction of the east and inclines toward the south, proceed extirpation, drought, pestilence, and destruction.",
        "76:6": "Out of the second gate, (located) directly in the center, proceed rain and fruitfulness together with dew. Out of the third gate, which is in the direction of the northeast, proceed (both) cold and drought.",
        "76:7": "After these winds, there go out the southerly ones through three gates. Among these, out of the first gate, which inclines in the direction of the east, proceed the winds of heat.",
        "76:8": "Out of the central gate, which is next to it, proceed beautiful fragrance, dew, rain, peace, and life.",
        "76:9": "And out of the third gate, in the direction of the west, proceed dew, rain, young locusts, and desolation.",
        "76:10": "After these, there goes (the group) of the northerly winds whose name is the Sea. There proceed from the seventh gate, which is in the direction of the east, toward the south, dew, rain, young locusts, and desolation.",
        "76:11": "Out of the central gate proceed life, rain, and dew directly; and out of the third gate, which is in the direction of the west, which inclines toward the northeast, proceed cloud, frost, snow, rain, dew, and young locusts.",
        "76:12": "After these come the fourth (group) of winds—the westerly. Out of the first gate, which is in the northeasterly direction, proceed dew, frost, cold, snow, and hoarfrost.",
        "76:13": "Out of the central gate proceed dew, rain, peace, and blessing. And out of the last gate, which is in the direction of the south, proceed drought, desolation, burning, and destruction.",
        "76:14": "Thus the twelve openings of the four heavenly directions are completed; all their orders, all their evil effects, and all their beneficial effects have I revealed to you, (O) my son, Methuselah!",
        "77:1": "* The first direction is called the Orient, because it is the very first.",
        "77:2": "The second is called the South, because the Most High will descend there, indeed because the Eternally Blessed will descend there.",
        "77:3": "(The third) direction is the Occident, its name (means) the diminished, (because) there all the luminaries of the sky wane and descend.",
        "77:4": "The fourth direction, whose name is the North, is divided into three parts: One of them is the dwelling of human beings; the second the seas of water, lakes, forests, rivers, darkness, and clouds; and the third part the garden of righteousness.",
        "77:5": "I saw seven high mountains which were higher than all the mountains of the earth; out of them proceeds frost; and days and year(s) traverse (them) in due season.",
        "77:6": "I saw seven rivers upon the earth, larger than all the rivers; one of them emerges from the West and empties its water into the Great Sea.",
        "77:7": "Two (others) come from the Northeast to the sea and empty their water into the Erythraean Sea, in the East.",
        "77:8": "The four remaining ones come out of the side of the Northeast to their own (respective) seas—(two of them) to the Erythraean Sea and two of them to the Great Sea, pouring themselves therein; some say to the seventh desert.",
        "77:9": "I (also) saw big islands in the sea and the land—seventy-two in the Erythraean Sea.",
        "78:1": "These are the names of the sun: the first, ʾOryares and the second, Tomas.",
        "78:2": "The moon has four names: Its first name is Asenya; its second, ʾAbla; the third, Banase; and the fourth, ʾEra.",
        "78:3": "These are the two great luminaries. Their roundness is like the roundness of the sky; and the magnitude of their roundness is equivalent for both.",
        "78:4": "There are seven (more) portions of light that move in the sun’s sphere than in the moon’s and it increases in measure until seventy portions of the sun are completed.",
        "78:5": "The (moon) comes in and goes out by the western openings, and circles via the northeast and rises through the eastern openings upon the face of the earth.",
        "78:6": "When the moon (begins its cycle), it appears in the sky one half of a seventh part; it will become fully illumined from the fourteenth (day);",
        "78:7": "it completes its illumination the fifteenth, becoming fulfilled according to the sign of the year and becoming fifteen parts. Thus the moon waxes in fifteen parts.",
        "78:8": "In its waning, (the moon) decreases on the first day to fourteen parts of its light; on the second day, it decreases to thirteen parts of light; on the third, to twelve parts; on the fourth, to eleven parts; on the fifth, to ten parts; on the sixth, to nine parts; on the seventh, to eight parts; on the eighth, to seven parts; on the ninth, to six parts; on the tenth, to five parts; on the eleventh, to four parts; on the twelfth, to three parts; on the thirteenth, to one half (of the preceding); on the fourteenth, all its light decreases to one half of one seventh; and on the fifteenth, all the remaining (light) disappears.",
        "78:9": "In certain fixed months, the moon completes its cycle every twenty-nine days, (in certain others), every twenty-eight.",
        "78:10": "Then Uriel showed me another order (concerning) when light is beamed into the moon, from which (direction) of the bright sun it is beamed.",
        "78:11": "During all the seasons when the moon is made to run its cycle, the light is being beamed into it (the moon) facing the sun until the illumination (of the moon) is completed in the course of fourteen days; and when it is lit completely, it radiates light in the sky.",
        "78:12": "On the first day, it is called the new moon because on that day the illumination begins to set upon it.",
        "78:13": "These (illuminations) are completed with exactitude on the day when the sun descends into the west, and the moon (simultaneously) rises in the east in the evening, shining during the night until the sun rises opposite it, and it is over against the sun.",
        "78:14": "From the same side where light entered the moon, from there also it (gradually) wanes until all the illumination disappears and the days of the moon expire, its disk empty without light.",
        "78:15": "(The moon) coordinates, in respect to its days and seasons, (four) three-month (divisions). In the course of its recession it makes (three months each in thirty days) and three months each in twenty-nine days; during this season it makes its recession, in the first period, (starting) in the first gate, (in) one hundred and seventy-seven days.",
        "78:16": "In the course (of) its progression, it appears three months each in thirty days and three months each in twenty-nine days.",
        "78:17": "By night it appears like a man, and by day it appears like the sky; for there is no other thing in it except its light.",
        "79:1": "(Thus) now, my son, I have revealed to you everything; (so) the rules concerning all the stars of heaven are concluded (here).",
        "79:2": "(Indeed) he showed me all their respective rules for every day, for every season, and for every year; the procession of each one according to the commandment, every month and every week.",
        "79:3": "(He showed me) the total decrement (i.e. during a half lunar year) of the moon which it makes (from the first) through the sixth gate, for (after) the light of this sixth gate is disposed of (at the end of the series of the six gates), the beginning of the decrement",
        "79:4": "(i.e. during the other half lunar year) which it makes (in returning) in the first gate takes place in its own season until one hundred and seventy-seven days are fulfilled, following the rule of (counting) weeks, twenty-five (weeks) and two days.",
        "79:5": "(The moon) falls behind the sun according to the order of the stars exactly five days during one period (i.e. one half year), and when the place which you behold has been traversed.",
        "79:6": "Such is the appearance and the picture of all the luminaries which Uriel the archangel, who is their leader, showed unto me.",
        "80:1": "In those days, the angel Uriel responded and said to me, “Behold, I have shown you everything, Enoch, and I have revealed everything to you (so that) you might see this sun, this moon, and those that guide the stars of heaven as well as all those who interchange their activities and their seasons and rotate their processions.",
        "80:2": "In respect to their days, the sinners and the winter are cut short. Their seed(s)f shall lag behind in their lands and in their fertile fields, and in all their activities upon the earth. He will turn and appear in their time, and withhold rain; and the sky shall stand still at that time.",
        "80:3": "Then the vegetable shall slacken and not grow in its season, and the fruit shall not be born in its (proper) season.",
        "80:4": "The moon shall alter its order, and will not be seen according to its (normal) cycles.",
        "80:5": "In those days it will appear in the sky and it shall arrive in the evening in the extreme ends of the great lunar path, in the west. And it shall shine (more brightly), exceeding the normal degree of light.",
        "80:6": "Many of the chiefs of the stars shall make errors in respect to the orders given to them; they shall change their courses and functions and not appear during the seasons which have been prescribed for them.",
        "80:7": "All the orders of the stars shall harden (in disposition) against the sinners and the conscience of those that dwell upon the earth. They (the stars) shall err against them (the sinners); and modify all their courses. Then they (the sinners) shall err and take them (the stars) to be gods.",
        "80:8": "And evil things shall be multiplied upon them; and plagues shall come upon them, so as to destroy all.",
        "81:1": "Then he said unto me, “Enoch, look at the tablet(s) of heaven; read what is written upon them and understand (each element on them) one by one.",
        "81:2": "So I looked at the tablet(s) of heaven, read all the writing (on them), and came to understand everything. I read that book and all the deeds of humanity and all the children of the flesh upon the earth for all the generations of the world.",
        "81:3": "At that very moment, I blessed the Great Lord, the King of Glory for ever, for he has created all the phenomena in the world. I praised the Lord because of his patience; and I wept on account of the children of the people upon the earth.",
        "81:4": "After that, I said: Blessed is the man who dies righteous and upright, against whom no record of oppression has been written, and who received no judgment on that day.",
        "81:5": "Then the seven holy ones brought me and placed me on the ground in front of the gate of my house, and said to me, “Make everything known to your son, Methuselah, and show to all your children that no one of the flesh can be just before the Lord; for they are merely his own creation.",
        "81:6": "We shall let you stay with your son for one year, so that you may teach your children another law and write it down for them and give all of them a warning; and in the second year, you shall be taken away from (among) all of them.",
        "81:7": "Let your heart be strong! For the upright shall announce righteousness to the upright; and the righteous ones shall rejoice with the righteous ones and congratulate each other.",
        "81:8": "But the sinners shall die together with the sinners; and the apostate shall sink together with the apostate.",
        "81:9": "But those who do right shall not die on account of the (evil) deeds of the people; it will gather on account of the deeds of the evil ones.”",
        "81:10": "In those days, (those seven holy ones) concluded speaking with me; and then I returned to my people, blessing the Lord of the universe.",
        "82:1": "Now, Methuselah, my son, I shall recount all these things to you and write them down for you. I have revealed to you and given you the book concerning all these things. Preserve, my son, the book from your father’s hands in order that you may pass it to the generations of the world.",
        "82:2": "I have given wisdom to you, to your children, and to those who shall become your children in order that they may pass it (in turn) to their own children and to the generations that are discerning. All the wise ones shall give praise, and wisdom shall dwell upon your consciousness;",
        "82:3": "they shall not slumber but be thinking; they shall cause their ears to listen in order that they may learn this wisdom; and it shall please those who feast on it more than good food.",
        "82:4": "Blessed are all the righteous ones; blessed are those who walk in the street of righteousness and have no sin like the sinners in the computation of the days in which the sun goes its course in the sky. It (the sun) comes in through a door and rises for thirty days together with the chiefs of the thousands of the orders of the stars, together with the four which are added to determine the intervals within (the year, that is, the intervals) between the four seasons of the year; those that lead them along come in on four days.",
        "82:5": "On this account there are people that err; they count them (the four?) in the computation of the year: for the people make error and do not recognize them accurately; for they belong to the reckoning of the year.",
        "82:6": "Truly, they are recorded forever: one in the first gate, one in the third, one in the fourth, and one in the sixth. The year is completed in three hundred and sixty-four days.",
        "82:7": "True is the matter of the exact computation of that which has been recorded; for Uriel—whom the Lord of all the creation of the world has ordered for me (in order to explain) the host of heaven—has revealed to me and breathed over me concerning the luminaries, the months, the festivals, the years, and the days.",

        "82:11": "The four leaders which distinguish the four seasons of the year enter first; after them (enter) the twelve leaders of the orders which distinguish the months; and the three hundred and sixty captains which divide the days and the four epagomenal days, (and) leaders which divide the four seasons of the year.",
        "82:12": "These captains over thousands are added between leader and leader, each behind a place to stand; but their leaders make the division.",
        "82:13": "And these are the names of the leaders which divide the four seasons of the years which are fixed: Malkiʾēl, Hēlaʾemmemēlek, Milāyʾul, and Nārēl.",

        "82:15": "At the very beginning, Malkiyal, whose name is called Tamʾayen—and the sun—rises and rules; and all the days of his authority—during which he reigns—are ninety-one days.",
        "82:16": "And these are the signs of the days which become manifest during the period of his authority: sweat, heat, and dryness; all the trees bear fruit (and) leaves grow on all trees; (there will be) good harvest, rose flowers, and all the flowers which grow in the field; but the winter tree shall wither.",
        "82:17": "And these are the names of the leaders which are their subordinates: Berkāʾēl, Zalebsāʾēl, and another additional one, a captain of a thousand, named Hēluyāsāf—the days of the authority of this one have been completed.",

        "83:2": "I saw two (visions) before I got married; and neither one of them resembles the other: The first one (I saw) when I (was beginning to) learn book(s), and the second, before I got married to your mother. First, I saw a scary vision regarding which I prayed to the Lord.",
        "83:3": "I was (then) sleeping in my grandfather Mahalalel’s house, and I saw in a vision the sky being hurled down and snatched and falling upon the earth.",
        "83:4": "When it fell upon the earth, I saw the earth being swallowed up into the great abyss, the mountains being suspended upon mountains, the hills sinking down upon the hills, and tall trees being uprooted and thrown and sinking into the deep abyss.",

        "83:7": "And I recounted to him the whole vision which I had seen. And he said unto me, “How terrifying a thing have you seen, my son! You have seen in your dream a powerful vision—all the sins of the whole world as it was sinking into the abyss and being destroyed with great destruction.",
        "83:8": "Now, my son, rise and pray to the Lord of glory, for you are a man of faith, so that a remnant shall remain upon the earth and that the whole earth shall not be blotted out.”",
        "83:9": "My son, all the things upon the earth shall take place from heaven; and there will occur a great destruction upon the earth.",
        "83:10": "After that, I rose and prayed, made a petition, and begged; and I wrote down all the prayers of the generations of the world. I will show you everything, my son, Methuselah.",
        "83:11": "Had I descended underneath and seen the sky, the sun rising in the east, the moon descending in the west, the diminishing of the stars, and the whole earth, I would have recognized everything upon her. So I blessed the Lord of judgment and extolled him. For he has made the sun to come out from the windows of the east; so it ascended and rose upon the face of the sky, starting to go the way that it was shown.",
        "84:1": "Then I raised up my hands in righteousness and blessed the Holy and Great One; and I spoke with the breath of my mouth and the tongue of flesh which God has made for the children of the flesh, the people, so that they should speak with it; he gave them the breath and the mouth so that they should speak with it.",
        "84:2": "Blessed are you, O Great King, you are mighty in your greatness, O Lord of all the creation of heaven, King of kings and God of the whole world. Your authority and kingdom abide forever and ever; and your dominion throughout all the generations of generations; all the heavens are your throne forever, and the whole earth is your footstool forever and ever and ever.",
        "84:3": "For you have created (all), and all things you rule; not a single thing is hard for you—(absolutely) not a single thing or wisdom; Your throne has not retreated from her station nor from before your presence. Everything you know, you see, and you hear; nothing exists that can be hidden from you, for everything you expose.",
        "84:4": "The angels of your heavens are now committing sin (upon the earth), and your wrath shall rest upon the flesh of the people until (the arrival of) the great day of judgment",
        "84:5": "“Now, O God, and Lord and Great King, I pray and beg so that you may sustain my prayer and save for me (a generation) that will succeed me in the earth; and do not destroy all the flesh of the people and empty the earth (so that) there shall be eternal destruction.",
        "84:6": "Do now destroy, O my Lord, the flesh that has angered you from upon the earth, but sustain the flesh of righteousness and uprightness as a plant of eternal seed; and hide not your face from the prayer of your servant, O Lord.”",
        "85:1": "After this, I saw another dream; and I will show you everything, my son.",
        "85:2": "Then Enoch responded and said to his son, Methuselah: I shall speak to you, my son, hear my words and incline your ears to the dream vision of your father.",
        "85:3": "Before I married your mother, Edna, I was seeing a vision on my bed, and behold a cow emerged from the earth, and that bovid was snow-white; and after it, there came forth one female calf together with two other calves, one of which was dark and the other red.",
        "85:4": "The dark calf gored that red calf and pursued it over the earth; thereafter I was not able to see that red calf.",
        "85:5": "But the dark calf grew big, and it brought along that female calf; and I saw that many bovids, which resembled it, proceeded forth from it, and followed after them.",
        "85:6": "That first heifer departed from before the face of that first bovid, and looked for that red calf, but could not find it; so she lamented over it with great lamentation, in searching for it.",
        "85:7": "I kept looking until that first cow came and quieted her; from that moment, she stopped crying.",
        "85:8": "After that she bore two snow-white cows; and after it she bore many more cows as well as dark heifers.",
        "85:9": "I also saw in my sleep that snow-white bull, and he grew big likewise and became a great snow-white bull; and there proceeded forth from him many snow-white cows which resembled him.",
        "85:10": "Then they began to give birth to many snow-white cows which resembled them, each one following many others.",
        "86:1": "Again I saw (a vision) with my own eyes as I was sleeping, and saw the lofty heaven; and as I looked, behold, a star fell down from heaven but (managed) to rise and eat and to be pastured among those cows.",
        "86:2": "Then I saw these big and dark cows, and behold they all changed their cattle-sheds, their pastures, and their calves; and they began to lament with each other.",
        "86:3": "Once again I saw a vision, and I observed the sky and behold, I saw many stars descending and casting themselves down from the sky upon that first star; and they became bovids among those calves and were pastured together with them, in their midst.",
        "86:4": "I kept observing, and behold, I saw all of them extending their sexual organs like horses and commencing to mount upon the heifers, the bovids; and they (the latter) all became pregnant and bore elephants, camels, and donkeys.",
        "86:5": "So (the cattle) became fearful and frightened of them and began to bite with their teeth and swallow and to gore with their horns.",
        "86:6": "Then they began to eat those bovids. And behold, all the children of the earth began to tremble and to shake before them and to flee from them.",
        "87:1": "Again I saw them commencing to gore and devour one another; so the earth began to cry aloud.",
        "87:2": "And I lifted my eyes unto heaven and saw a vision: And behold, there came forth from heaven (a being) in the form of a snow-white person—one came out of that place and three (others) with him.",
        "87:3": "Those ones which had come out last seized me by my hand and took me from the generations of the earth, lifted me up into a high place, and showed me a high tower above the earth, and all the hills were firm.",
        "87:4": "(One of them) said to me, “Stay here until you see everything that will happen to these elephants, camels, and donkeys, as well as to the stars and to the bovids—all of them.”",
        "88:1": "I then saw one of those four who had come out earlier seizing that first star, binding his hands and feet, and throwing him into an abyss—this abyss was narrow and deep, empty and dark.",
        "88:2": "Also one of them drew a sword and gave it to those elephants, camels, and donkeys; then they began to attack one another, and on account of them the whole earth was quaking.",
        "88:3": "And as I continued to see in the vision, behold, from that time, one of the four, among those who had come out, was stoning from the sky, and gathering and taking away all the mighty stars, whose sexual organs were like the sexual organs of horses; then he bound all of them hand and foot, and cast them into the pits of the earth.",
        "89:1": "Then one of those four went to those snow-white bovids and taught (one of them) a secret: he was born a bovid but became a person; and he built for himself a big boat and dwelt upon it. Three cows dwelt together with him in that boat, and that boat was covered (over) them.",
        "89:2": "Again I raised my eyes toward heaven, and saw a lofty ceiling with seven cascading streams upon it; and those cascading streams flowed with much water into one enclosed area.",
        "89:3": "Again I saw, and behold, fountains were opened upon the ground of that great enclosed area, and the water began to swell and rise upon the ground; and I saw that enclosed area until the whole ground was (completely) covered with water.",
        "89:4": "Water, darkness, and mist accumulated heavily upon it; and I looked at the ascent of that water going up and up until it rose above that enclosed area, and was streaming above the enclosed area; thus it was standing above the ground.",
        "89:5": "And everything that was in the enclosed area; and (all those on the ground) were gathered together until I saw them sinking, being swallowed up, and perishing in that water.",
        "89:6": "Yet that boat was floating above the water, though all the cattle, elephants, camels, and donkeys were sinking to the bottom; so I could (no longer) see any one of the animals (for) they had no ability to come out but (only) to perish and sink into the deep water.",
        "89:7": "Again I kept seeing in the vision until those cascading streams were dissipated from that high ceiling, the fountains of the earth were normalized, and other pits were opened.",
        "89:8": "Then the water began to descend into them until the ground became visible, that boat settled upon the earth, the darkness vanished, and it became light.",
        "89:9": "Then the snow-white cow which became a man came out from that boat together with three cows. One of those three cows was snow-white, similar to that (first) cow, and one of them red like blood. Now that (first) snow-white cow departed from them.",
        "89:10": "Then they began to bear the beasts of the fields and the birds. There arose out of them all classes of population: lions, leopards, wolves, snakes, hyenas, wild boars, foxes, squirrels, swine, hawks, eagles, kites, striped crow(s), and ravens. Among them there was also born a snow-white cow.",
        "89:11": "Then they began to bite one another among themselves. That snow-white cow which was born in their midst begat a wild ass, and a snow-white cow with it; and the wild asses multiplied.",
        "89:12": "And that cow which was born from him bore a black wild boar and a snow-white sheep; the former then bore healthy beasts and the latter bore twelve sheep.",
        "89:13": "When those twelve sheep had grown up, they gave away one of their own members to the donkeys, which in turn gave him away to the wolves; so this sheep grew up in the midst of the wolves.",
        "89:14": "Then the Lord brought the eleven sheep to dwell with him, and to pasture in the midst of the wolves; and they multiplied and became many flocks of sheep.",
        "89:15": "Then the wolves began to fear them; so they tortured them until their little ones were being killed (for) they cast away their little ones into a river of great quantity of water. So those sheep began to cry aloud on behalf of their little ones and to complain unto their Lord.",
        "89:16": "Then one sheep which had been saved from the wolves fled and escaped to the wild asses. But I saw the sheep continuing to lament and cry aloud; and they kept praying to their Lord with all their strength until the Lord of the sheep descended at their entreatment, from a lofty palace, arriving to visit them.",
        "89:17": "He called that sheep which had escaped from the wolves and told him concerning the wolves that he should warn the wolves not to touch the sheep.",
        "89:18": "The sheep then went to the wolves in accordance with the word of the Lord, together with another sheep which he had met, so the two of them went on and arrived together into the assembly of those wolves, and spoke to them and warned them not to touch the sheep.",
        "89:19": "But thenceforth I saw how the wolves even intensified their pressure upon the sheep. They, the sheep, cried aloud—they cried aloud with all their strength.",
        "89:20": "Then their Lord came to (the rescue of) the sheep, whereupon they began to whip those wolves. So the wolves began to make lamentations, but the sheep thereafter became quiet and stopped crying aloud.",
        "89:21": "I continued to see the sheep until they departed from (the presence) of the wolves, and the wolves (until) their eyes were dazzled; yet the wolves went out to pursue those sheep, with all their might.",
        "89:22": "But the Lord of the sheep went with them as their leader, while all his sheep were following him; his face was glorious, adorable, and marvelous to behold.",
        "89:23": "As for the wolves, they continue to pursue those sheep until they found them at a certain pool of water.",
        "89:24": "Then the pool of water was rent asunder, and the water stood apart on this and on that side before their very eyes, and their Lord, their leader, stood between them and the wolves.",
        "89:25": "Those wolves were still not able to see the sheep, and (the sheep) walked through that pool of water; then the wolves followed the sheep and ran after them into that pool of water.",
        "89:26": "Then when they saw the Lord of the sheep, they turned in order to flee from before his face. But that pool of water gathered itself together and immediately returned to its normal state, the water became full and rose high until it covered (completely) those wolves.",
        "89:27": "Thus I saw till the wolves which pursued those sheep perished and were drowned.",
        "89:28": "So the sheep proceeded past that water and arrived in the desert, where there was no water or grass; but they began to open their eyes and see. Then I saw the Lord of the sheep bringing them to a pasture and giving them grass and water. Also that sheep was leading them as they were proceeding forward.",
        "89:29": "That sheep then ascended to the summit of that lofty rock; and the Lord of the sheep sent (him) to them",
        "89:30": "After that, I saw the Lord of the sheep, who stood before them; his appearance was majestic, marvelous, and powerful; all those sheep beheld him and were afraid before his face.",
        "89:31": "All of them feared and trembled because of him, and cried aloud to that sheep (who was) leading them and to the other sheep who was also in their midst, saying, “We are not able to stand before the presence of our Lord and to look at him.”",
        "89:32": "Then that sheep which was leading them turned back and (again) ascended to the summit of that rock; meanwhile the sheep began to be dim-sighted in their eyes, and went astray from the path which he had shown them; but that sheep was not aware of it.",
        "89:33": "So the Lord of the sheep became angry at them with great wrath; and that sheep became aware of it, and having descended from the summit of that rock, came to the sheep and found that the majority of them had been blinded in their eyes and gone astray.",
        "89:34": "And those who saw him became afraid, trembling in his presence, and wanted to return to their folds.",
        "89:35": "So that sheep took some other different sheep together with them and came to those sheep which had gone astray, slaying them; and the sheep became frightened in his presence. He, that sheep, thus caused those sheep which went astray to return, and brought them back into their folds.",
        "89:36": "I continued to see in that vision till that sheep was transformed into a man and built a house for the Lord of the sheep, and placed the sheep in it.",
        "89:37": "I, moreover, continued to see until that sheep, which had met the sheep that was their leader, fell asleep and all the senior sheep perished, junior ones rising to take their places. Then coming into a pasture, they approached a stream of water.",
        "89:38": "(There) that sheep who was leading them—the one who had become a man—departed from them, and all of them went to sleep. (Then the rest of) the sheep sought him; and there took place a great cry over him.",
        "89:39": "And I kept looking till they quieted down from crying for that sheep, crossed that stream of water, and all of the sheep stopped. Those who were leading them made agreements with those whom they found, and they led them.",
        "89:40": "I still kept seeing the sheep till they arrived at a very pleasant place and in a land beautiful and glorious; I saw those sheep being satiated; and that house was in their midst in the beautiful land, by which their eyes become opened.",
        "89:41": "And when their eyes become dim-sighted until another sheep arose and led them, they would all return and their eyes became opened.",
        "89:42": "Now the dogs, foxes, and the wild boars began to devour those sheep till the Lord of the sheep raised up another sheep, one from among them—a ram which would lead them.",
        "89:43": "That ram began to fight on all sides those dogs, foxes, and wild boars until he destroyed all of them.",
        "89:44": "Then that sheep had his eyes opened; and he saw that ram which was among the sheep, how he abandoned his own glory and began to attack those sheep, to trample upon them, and went away without dignity.",
        "89:45": "So the Lord of the sheep sent the sheep to another sheep and promoted him to become a ram and lead the sheep in place of that sheep which had abandoned his own glory.",
        "89:46": "After having gone to him, he spoke to him privately and raised that ram, making him a judge and a leader of the people—throughout (this time) the dogs were continuing to covet the sheep.",
        "89:47": "The first ram then persecuted that second ram, so that latter ram arose and escaped from before his (the former’s) presence; and then I continued to look until those dogs toppled that first sheep.",
        "89:48": "But that second ram arose and led the little sheep. That ram begat many sheep and fell asleep before a little sheep became a ram in his place, a judge and a leader of those sheep.",
        "89:49": "Those sheep grew and multiplied, but all those dogs, foxes, and wild boars feared and fled before him. That ram attacked and killed all the wild beasts; and all the wild beasts were no longer able to return among the sheep or to rob absolutely anything from them.",
        "89:50": "Then that house became great and spacious; a lofty building was built upon it for that sheep, as well as a tall and great tower upon if for the Lord of the sheep; that house was low but the tower was really elevated and lofty. Then the Lord of the sheep stood upon that tower, and they offered a full table before him.",
        "89:51": "Again I saw those sheep, how they went astray, going in diverse ways and abandoning that house of his. Then the Lord of the sheep called some from among the sheep and sent them to the sheep, but the sheep began to slay them.",
        "89:52": "However, one of them was not killed but escaped alive and fled away; he cried aloud to the sheep, and they wanted to kill him, but the Lord of the sheep rescued him from the sheep and caused him to ascend to me and settle down.",
        "89:53": "He sent many other sheep to those sheep to testify to them and to lament over them.",
        "89:54": "Thereafter I saw that, when they abandoned the house of the Lord and his tower, they went astray completely, and their eyes became blindfolded. Then I saw the Lord of the sheep, how he executed much slaughter upon them, in their flocks, until those sheep (began to) invoke that slaughter, and he vindicated his place.",
        "89:55": "He left them in the hands of the lions, leopards, and wolves, hyenas, as well as in the hands of the foxes and to all the wild beasts; and these wild beasts of the wilderness began to tear those sheep into pieces.",
        "89:56": "I saw how he left that house of theirs and that tower of theirs and cast all of them into the hands of the lions—(even) into the hands of all the wild beasts—so that they may tear them into pieces and eat them.",
        "89:57": "Then I began to cry aloud with all my strength and to call upon the Lord of the lions and to reveal to him concerning the sheep, for he had fed them to all the wild beasts.",
        "89:58": "But he remained quiet and happy because they were being devoured, swallowed, and snatched; so he abandoned them into the hands of all the wild beasts for food.",
        "89:59": "He then summoned seventy shepherds and surrendered those sheep to them so that they might pasture them. He spoke to the shepherds and their colleagues, “From now on, let each and every one of you graze the sheep; and do everything which I command you.",
        "89:60": "I shall hand them over to you duly counted and tell you which among them are to be destroyed; and you shall destroy them!”",
        "89:61": "So he handed over those sheep to them. Then calling another (group of shepherds), he told them, “Take notice and see everything which the shepherds will do to those sheep; for they will destroy from among them a greater number than those which I have commanded them.",
        "89:62": "You write down every excess and destruction that will be wrought through the shepherds—how many they destroy according to my command, and how many they will destroy of their own accord! Write down every destruction that each and every shepherd causes, against their records!",
        "89:63": "And read aloud before me each particular case—how many they destroy and how many they give over to destruction—so that this may become a testimony for me against them, so that I may know all the deeds of the shepherds, (and) so that I may evaluate them and see what they do, whether they act according to my command which I have commanded them or not.",
        "89:64": "If they do not know it, do not reveal it to them, neither admonish them, but write down every destruction caused by the shepherds—for each and every one in his appointed time—and elevate all of it to me.”",
        "89:65": "And I saw till those shepherds in their appointed time pastured (the sheep) and began killing and destroying many in excess of what they had been commanded; and they abandoned those sheep into the hands of the lions.",
        "89:66": "So the lions and the leopards ate and devoured the majority of those sheep; the wild boars also ate along with them. Then they burned that tower and plowed that house.",
        "89:67": "And I became exceedingly sorrowful on account of that tower, for that house of the sheep was being plowed; thereafter I was unable to see whether those sheep could enter that house.",
        "89:68": "So the shepherds and their colleagues handed over those sheep to all the wild beasts so that they might devour them. At the appointed time, each one among them (the shepherds) receives (the sheep) in a fixed number; and each one among them (the shepherds) hands them (the sheep) over to the other (the colleague) in a fixed number. (then) they shall write down for the other (the colleague) in a book how many among them (the sheep) would perish.",
        "89:69": "Each and every one of them kills and destroys in excess of their order. So I began to weep and cry aloud on account of those sheep.",
        "89:70": "In this manner I saw that writer in my vision—how he writes down that which was destroyed by those shepherds, every day, and (how) he elevates, puts down, and shows the whole book to the Lord of the sheep; everything that each one has done; everything that each and every one of them has eliminated; and everything that they have given over to destruction.",
        "89:71": "The book was read before the Lord of the sheep; and he took it from his hand, read it, sealed it, and laid it down.",
        "89:72": "Thereafter I saw the shepherds pasturing for twelve hours: behold, three of those sheep returning, arriving, entering, and beginning to build all (the parts) of that house which had fallen down! The wild boars came and tried to hinder them but were unsuccessful.",
        "89:73": "They again began to build as before; and they raised up that tower which is called the high tower. But they started to place a table before the tower, with all the food which is upon it being polluted and impure.",
        "89:74": "Regarding all these matters, the eyes of the sheep became so dim-sighted that they could not see—and likewise in respect to their shepherds—and they were delivered to their shepherds for an excessive destruction, so that the sheep were trampled upon and eaten.",
        "89:75": "The Lord of the sheep remained silent until all the sheep were dispersed into the woods and got mixed among the wild beasts,—and could not be rescued from the hands of the beasts.",
        "89:76": "The one who was writing a book elevated and showed it and read the grave words of the Lord of the sheep. He then pleaded to him and begged him on account of the sheep, while manifesting to him all the deeds of the shepherds and giving testimony before him against all the shepherds.",
        "89:77": "Then taking it, he placed that very book beside him in this manner and departed.",
        "90:1": "Then I saw after that how thirty-seven shepherds were pasturing (the sheep); all of them completed (their duties) in their own respective periods, like the former ones; and aliens took (the sheep) into their hands in order to pasture them in their own respective periods—each shepherd in his own period.",
        "90:2": "After that I saw with my own eyes all the birds of heaven—eagles, vultures, kites, and ravens—coming; the eagles were the ones who were leading all the birds; and they began to eat those sheep, to dig out their eyes, and to eat their flesh.",
        "90:3": "Then the sheep cried aloud, for their flesh was being eaten by the birds. I, too, cried aloud and lamented in my sleep on account of that shepherd who was grazing the sheep.",
        "90:4": "I kept seeing till those sheep were eaten by the dogs, the eagles, and the kites; and they left neither flesh, nor skin, nor sinew on them absolutely, until their bones stood there bare; then their bones fell to the ground, and the sheep became few.",
        "90:5": "I kept seeing till twenty-three shepherds pastured (the sheep), and all of them completed fifty-eight seasons in their own respective periods.",
        "90:6": "Then, behold lambs were born from those snow-white sheep; and they began to open their eyes and see, and cried aloud to the sheep.",
        "90:7": "But as for the sheep, they (the Iambs) cried aloud to them, yet they (the sheep) did not listen to what they (the lambs) were telling them but became exceedingly deafened, and their eyes became exceedingly dim-sighted.",
        "90:8": "Then I saw in a vision ravens flying above those lambs, and they seized one of those lambs; and then smashing the sheep, they ate them.",
        "90:9": "I kept seeing till those lambs grew horns; but the ravens crushed their horns. Then I kept seeing till one great horn sprouted on one of those sheep, and he opened their eyes; and they had vision in them and their eyes were opened.",
        "90:10": "He cried aloud to the sheep, and all the rams saw him and ran unto him.",
        "90:11": "In spite of this, all those eagles, vultures, ravens, and kites until now continue to rip the sheep, swooping down upon them and eating them. As for the sheep, they remain silent; but the rams are lamenting and crying aloud.",
        "90:12": "Those ravens gather and battle with him (the horned ram) and seek to remove his horn, but without any success.",
        "90:13": "I saw thereafter the shepherds coming; and those vultures and kites cried aloud to the ravens so that they should smash the horn of that ram. But he battled with them, and they fought each other; and he cried aloud, while battling with them, so that (God’s) help should come.",
        "90:14": "I kept seeing till that man, who writes down the names of the shepherds and elevates them before the Lord of the sheep, came; it is he who helped him and revealed (to him) everything; thus help came down for that is ram.",
        "90:15": "And I kept seeing till the Lord of the sheep came upon them in wrath, and all who saw him fled and fell all into darkness, from before his face.",
        "90:16": "All the eagles, vultures, ravens, and kites gathered, with all the sheep of the field lining up with them; and having thus come together in unity, all of them cooperated in order to smash the horn of the ram.",
        "90:17": "I saw that man who was writing a book by the command of the Lord, for he opened that book (of) the destruction which those twelve last shepherds caused; and he revealed before the Lord of the sheep that they had much is greater destruction than their predecessors.",
        "90:18": "I kept seeing till the Lord of the sheep came unto them and took in his hand the rod of his wrath and smote the earth; and all the beasts and all the birds of the heaven fell down from the midst of those sheep and were swallowed up in the earth, and it was covered upon them.",
        "90:19": "Then I saw that a great sword was given to the sheep; and the sheep proceeded against all the beasts of the field in order to kill them; and all the beasts and birds of heaven fled from before their face.",
        "90:20": "Then I kept seeing till a throne was erected in a pleasant land; and he sat upon if for the Lord of the sheep; and he took all the sealed books and opened those very books in the presence of the Lord of the sheep.",
        "90:21": "Then the Lord called those people, the seven first snow-white ones, and ordered them to bring before him (some) from among the first star(s) that arose, and from among those stars whose sexual organs were like those of the horses, as well as (that) first star which had fallen down earlier. And they brought them all before him.",

        "101:4": "Do you not see the sailors of the ships, how their ships are tossed up and down by the billows and are shaken by the winds, and they become anxious?",
        "101:5": "On this account (it is evident that) they are seized by fear, for they will discharge all their valuable property—the goods that are with them—into the sea; they think in their hearts that the sea will swallow them up and they will perish in it.",
        "101:6": "Is not the entire sea and all her waters and all her movements the very work of the Most High? Has he not ordered her courses of action and her waters—(indeed) her totality—with sand?",
        "101:7": "At his rebuke they become frightened, and she dries up; then her fish die and all that is in her. But you, sinners, who are upon the earth, fear him not!",
        "101:8": "Did he not make the heaven and the earth and all that is in them? Who gave the knowledge of wisdom to all those who move upon the earth and in the sea?",
        "101:9": "Do not the sailors of the ships fear the sea? Yet the sinners do not fear the Most High.",
        "102:1": "“In those days, when he hurls out against you terror of fire, where shall you flee, and where shall you find safety? When he flings his word against you, will you not faint and fear?",
        "102:2": "All the luminaries shall faint with great fear; the whole earth shall faint and tremble and panic.",
        "102:3": "All the angels shall fulfill their orders. The children of the earth will seek to hide themselves from the presence of the Great Glory, trembling and confounded. You, sinners, you are accursed forever; there is no peace for you!",
        "102:4": "But you, souls of the righteous, fear not; and be hopeful, you souls that died in righteousness!",
        "102:5": "Be not sad because your souls have gone down into Sheol in sorrow; or (because) your flesh fared not well the earthly existence in accordance with your goodness; indeed the time you happened to be in existence was (a time of) sinners, a time of curse and a time of plague.",
        "102:6": "When you die, the sinners will speak over you: ‘As we die, so do the righteous die. What then have they gained by their deeds?",
        "102:7": "Behold, like us they died in grief and in darkness, and what have they more than we? From now on we have become equal.",
        "102:8": "What will they receive or what will they see forever? Behold they have surely died; and from now on they shall never see light forever.’",
        "102:9": "Now I tell you, sinners, you have satiated yourselves with food and drink, robbing and sin, impoverishing people and gaining property, and seeing good days.",
        "102:10": "Have you seen the righteous, how their end comes about, for no injustice is found upon them until their death?",
        "102:11": "But they perished and became like those who were not, and descended into Sheol—and their spirits too—with anguish.",
        "103:1": "“I now swear to you, righteous ones, by the glory of the Great One and by the glory of his kingdom; and I swear to you (even) by the Great One.",
        "103:2": "For I know this mystery; I have read the tablets of heaven and have seen the holy writings, and I have understood the writing in them; and they are inscribed concerning you.",
        "103:3": "For all good things, and joy and honor are prepared for and written down for the souls of those who died in righteousness. Many and good things shall be given to you—the offshoot of your labors. Your lot exceeds even that of the living ones.",
        "103:4": "The spirits of those who died in righteousness shall live and rejoice; their spirits shall not perish, nor their memorial from before the face of the Great One unto all the generations of the world. Therefore, do not worry about their humiliation.",
        "103:5": "“Woe unto you sinners who are dead! When you are dead in the wealth of your sins, those who are like you will say of you, ‘Happy are you sinners! (The sinners) have seen all their days.",
        "103:6": "They have died now in prosperity and wealth. They have not experienced struggle and battle in their lifetime. They have died in glory, and there was no judgment in their lifetime.’",
        "103:7": "You yourselves know that they will bring your souls down to Sheol; and they shall experience evil and great tribulation—in darkness, nets, and burning flame.",
        "103:8": "Your souls shall enter into the great judgment; it shall be a great judgment in all the generations of the world. Woe unto you, for there is no peace for you!",
        "103:9": "Now to the righteous and kind ones during their lifetime: Do not say, ‘In the days of our toil, we have surely suffered hardships and have experienced every trouble. We have faced many evil things and have become consumed. We have died and become few, (characterized) by the littleness of our spirit.",
        "103:10": "We have been destroyed; and we have found none whatsoever to help us with a word or otherwise. We have been tortured and destroyed, and could not even hope to see life from one day to the other.",
        "103:11": "We hoped to be the head and have become the tail We have moiled as we toiled, but had no authority over our own toil. We have become the victuals of the sinners and the oppressors; they have made their yoke heavy upon us.",
        "103:12": "Those who hate us, while goading us and encompassing us, have become masters over us. We have bowed our necks to those who hate us, but they had no pity on us.",
        "103:13": "We wanted to get away from them in order that we may escape and be at rest; but we found no place to which we might flee and be safe from them.",
        "103:14": "Then, in our tribulation, we brought a charge against them before the authorities, and cried out against those who were devouring us, but they (the authorities) neither would pay attention to our cries nor wish to listen to our voice.",
        "103:15": "But (on the contrary) they were assisting those who were robbing and devouring us, those who were causing us to diminish. They (the authorities) conceal their (the offenders’) injustice and do not remove the yokes of those who devour us, scatter us, and murder us; they (the authorities) cover up our murder; and they (the authorities) do not remember (the fact) that they (the offenders) have lifted up their hands against us.’",
        "104:1": "“I swear unto you that in heaven the angels will remember you for good before the glory of the Great One; and your names shall be written before the glory of the Great One.",
        "104:2": "Be hopeful, because formerly you have pined away through evil and toil. But now you shall shine like the lights of heaven, and you shall be seen; and the windows of heaven shall be opened for you. Your cry shall be heard.",
        "104:3": "Cry for judgment, and it shall appear for you; for all your tribulations shall be (demanded) for investigation from the (responsible) authorities—from everyone who assisted those who plundered you.",
        "104:4": "Be hopeful, and do not abandon your hope, because there shall be a fire for you; you are about to be making a great rejoicing like the angels of heaven.",
        "104:5": "You shall not have to hide on the day of the great judgment, and you shall not be found as the sinners; but the eternal judgment shall be (far) away from you for all the generations of the world.",
        "104:6": "Now fear not, righteous ones, when you see the sinners waxing strong and flourishing; do not be partners with them, but keep far away from those who lean onto their own injustice; for you are to be partners with the good-hearted people of heaven.",
        "104:7": "Now, you sinners, even if you say, ‘All our sins shall not be investigated or written down,’ nevertheless, all your sins are being written down every day.",
        "104:8": "So now I show unto you that light and darkness as well as day and night witness all your sins.",
        "104:9": "Do not become wicked in your hearts, or lie, or alter the words of a just verdict, or utter falsehood against the words of the Great, the Holy One, or give praise to your idols; for all your lies and all your wickedness are not for righteousness but for great sin.",
        "104:10": "And now I know this mystery: For they (the sinners) shall alter the just verdict and many sinners will take it to heart; they will speak evil words and lie, and they will invent fictitious stories and write out my Scriptures on the basis of their own words.",
        "104:11": "And would that they had written down all the words truthfully on the basis of their own speech, and neither alter nor take away from my words, all of which I testify to them from the beginning!",
        "104:12": "Again know another mystery!: that to the righteous and the wise shall be given the Scriptures of joy, for truth and great wisdom.",
        "104:13": "So to them shall be given the Scriptures; and they shall believe them and be glad in them; and all the righteous ones who learn from them the ways of truth shall rejoice.”",
        "105:1": "In those days, he says, “The Lord will be patient and cause the children of the earth to hear. Reveal it to them with your wisdom, for you are their guides; and (you are) a reward upon the whole earth.",
        "105:2": "Until I and my son are united with them forever in the upright paths in their lifetime and there shall be peace unto you, rejoice, you children of truth. Amen.”",
        "106:1": "And after some days my son, Methuselah, took a wife for his son Lamech, and she became pregnant by him and bore him a son.",
        "106:2": "And his body was white as snow and red as a rose; the hair of his head as white as wool and his demdema beautiful; and as for his eyes, when he opened them the whole house glowed like the sun—(rather) the whole house glowed even more exceedingly.",
        "106:3": "And when he arose from the hands of the midwife, he opened his mouth and spoke to the Lord with righteousness.",
        "106:4": "And his father, Lamech, was afraid of him and fled and went to Methuselah his father;",
        "106:5": "and he said to him, “I have begotten a strange son: He is not like an (ordinary) human being, but he looks like the children of the angels of heaven to me; his form is different, and he is not like us. His eyes are like the rays of the sun, and his face glorious.",
        "106:6": "It does not seem to me that he is of me, but of angels; and I fear that a wondrous phenomenon may take place upon the earth in his days.",
        "106:7": "So I am beseeching you now, begging you in order that you may go to his (grand)father Enoch, our father, and learn from him the truth, for his dwelling place is among the angels.”",
        "106:8": "When Methuselah heard the words of his son, he came to us at the ends of the earth; for he had heard that I was there. He cried aloud, and I heard his voice and came to him; and I said to him, “Behold, my son, here I am, why have you come here?”",
        "106:9": "Then he answered me and said, “On account of a great distress have I come to you, on account of a grievous vision have I come near here.",
        "106:10": "Now, my father, hear me: For unto my son Lamech a son has been born, one whose image and form are not like unto the characteristics of human beings; and his color is whiter than snow and redder than a rose, the hair of his head is whiter than white wool, and his eyes are like the rays of the sun; and (when) he opened his eyes the whole house lighted up.",
        "106:11": "And (when) he rose up in the hands of the midwife, he opened his mouth and blessed the Lord of heaven",
        "106:12": "Then his father, Lamech, became afraid and fled, and he did not believe that he (the child) was of him but of the image of the angels of heaven. And behold, I have come to you in order that you may make me know the real truth.”",
        "106:13": "Then I, Enoch, answered, saying to him, “The Lord will surely make new things upon the earth; and I have already seen this matter in a vision and made it known to you. For in the generation of Jared, my father, they transgressed the word of the Lord, (that is) the law of heaven.",
        "106:14": "And behold, they commit sin and transgress the commandment; they have united themselves with women and commit sin together with them; and they have married (wives) from among them, and begotten children by them",
        "106:15": "‘There shall be a great destruction upon the earth; and there shall be a deluge and a great destruction for one year.",
        "106:16": "And this son who has been born unto you shall be left upon the earth; and his three sons shall be saved when they who are upon the earth are dead.",
        "106:17": "And upon the earth they shall give birth to giants, not of the spirit but of the flesh. There shall be a great plague upon the earth, and the earth shall be washed clean from all the corruption.",
        "106:18": "Now, make known to your son Lamech that the son who has been born is indeed righteous; and call his name Noah, for he shall be the remnant for you; and he and his sons shall be saved from the corruption which shall come upon the earth on account of all the sin and oppression that existed, and it will be fulfilled upon the earth, in his days.",
        "106:19": "After that there shall occur still greater oppression than that which was fulfilled upon the earth the first time; for I do know the mysteries of the holy ones; for he, the Lord, has revealed (them) to me and made me know—and I have read (them) in the heavenly tablets.”",
        "107:1": "Then I beheld the writing upon them that one generation shall be more wicked than the other, until a generation of righteous ones shall arise, wickedness shall perish, sin shall disappear from upon the earth, and every good thing shall come upon her.",
        "107:2": "“And now, my son, go and make it known to your son Lamech that this son who has been born is his son in truth—and not in falsehood.”",
        "107:3": "And when Methuselah had heard the words of his father Enoch—for he revealed to him everything in secret—he returned (home). And he called the name of that son Noah, for he will comfort the earth after all the destruction.",
        "108:1": "Another Book of Enoch—which he wrote for his son Methuselah and for those who will come after him, observing the law in the last days.",
        "108:2": "You who have observed (the law)a shall wait patiently in all the days until (the time of) those who work evil is completed, and the power of the wicked ones is ended.",
        "108:3": "As for you, wait patiently until sin passes away, for the names of (the sinners)d shall be blotted out from the Book of Life and the books of the Holy One; their seeds shall be destroyed forever and their spirits shall perish and die; they shall cry and lament in a place that is an invisible wilderness and burn in the fire—for there exists ground there (as upon the earth).",
        "108:4": "I also saw there something like an invisible cloud; (and) though I could see that it was completely dark yet I could not see the flame of its fire because it was burning brightly; and there were some things like bright mountains which formed a ring (around it) and which were tossing it to and fro.",
        "108:5": "Then I asked one of the holy angels who was with me, saying to him, “What is this bright thing? For it is not a heaven but merely the flame of a fire which is burning—and a voice of weeping, crying, and lamenting as well as strong pain.”",
        "108:6": "And he said unto me, “This place which you see, into it shall be taken the spirits of sinners, blasphemers, those who do evil, and those who alter all the things which the Lord has done through the mouth of the prophets, all of which have to be fulfilled.",
        "108:7": "For some of (these things) were written and sealed above in heaven so that the angels may read them (the things that are written) and know that which is about to befall the sinners, the spirits of the ones who err, as well as those who defiled their bodies, revenged themselves on God, and worked together with evil people.",
        "108:8": "Those who love God have loved neither gold nor silver, nor all the good things which are in the world, but have given over their bodies to suffering—",
        "108:9": "who from the time of their very being have not longed after earthly food, and who regarded themselves as a (mere) passing breath. And they have observed this matter, the Lord having put them through much testing; then he received their pure spirits so that they should bless his name.",
        "108:10": "And I have recounted in the books all their blessings. He has caused them to be recompensed, for they were all found loving God more than the fire of their eternal souls; and while they were being trodden upon by evil people, experiencing abuse and insult by them, they continued blessing us.",
        "108:11": "So now I shall summon their spirits if they are born of light, and change those who are born in darkness—those whose bodies were not recompensed with honor as they deserved for their faithfulness.",
        "108:12": "I shall bring them out into the bright light, those who have loved my holy name, and seat them each one by one upon the throne of his honor;",
        "108:13": "and they shall be resplendent for ages that cannot be numbered; for the judgment of God is righteousness, because he will give faith—as well as the paths of truth—to the faithful ones in the resting place.",
        "108:14": "Then they shall see those who were born in darkness being taken into darkness, while the righteous ones shall is be resplendent.",
        "108:15": "(The sinners) shall cry aloud, and they shall see the righteous ones being resplendent; they shall go to the place which was prescribed for them concerning the days and the seasons.” Here ends the Revelation of the Secrets of Enoch."
